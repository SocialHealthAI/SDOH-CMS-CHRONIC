the consultant outlined a few circumstances that could contribute to better utilization ofthe economic potentia I of cultural heritage. Firstly, cultural heritage could provide a competitive advantage of the tourism and travel industry, if the marketing is focused on segments (i.e. groups of people) that are willing to pay more than average for their services. Secondly, there are several benefits of networking between individual companies, a single cultural site may not be sufficient to attract visitors, but as a part of a network of cultural sites, it may become more interesting. Investments in infrastructure and marketing require resources, and by joining forces more cost-effective solutions could be found.\",\"The political level at the county (regional) level is (with some exceptions) responsible mainly for healthcare (about 80% of their budgets), planning of transportation infrastructure, public transport, culture, and may engage in other areas such as tourism and culture. The government is currently investigating a major regional reform that will reduce the number of counties from the present 21 to 6 regions. In essence, this initiative formalises and expands upon a past decades trend to reinforce the role of regions, notably by transferring more decision-making power to them from the centre, especially in regional development issues.\",\"These estimates differ from density levels reported by SEDESOL\\u002fCONAPO\\u002fINEGI (2012), which are based on total surface area, urban and rural areas combined. This map is for illustrative purposes and is without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory covered by this map. Most of this growth occurred between 1980 and 2000.\",\"Local governments can apply for national subsidies that can be used to promote local investment to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency and independence. Examples of funded municipal activities include removing disincentives for individuals to reduce emissions, such as eliminating free parking, and subsidising the cost of retrofitting filling stations to add a pump to supply renewable biofuels (Corfee-Morlot et al., Such system should be developed and tailored to green growth\\u002fsustainable development\\u002fclimate change objectives in the Philippines.\",\"However, city akimats usually do not have budget allocations to order district-specific plans (Akimat of Uralsk City, 2015). In many cases, local governments have to attract additional financial resources to implement the plans. The short-term budget provisions diminish the city akimats’ capacity to forecast and be prepared for the long-term development of the city.\",\"Substantial increases in land productivity were achieved through strict enforcement of the adoption of high-yield crop varieties, subsidised fertiliser and pesticide programmes, and collection and distribution systems run by the government. In order to rebuild agriculture, the Saemaul Undong was first initiated from 1971 to 1973, under the strong leadership of the central government. At the beginning, 6 000 rural villages participated, increasing to 34 665 villages in 1973.\",\"In addition, there is a need to strengthen the capacity of Intendentes to prioritise and co-ordinate SEREMI activity and initiatives. It is entirely appropriate for line ministries to elaborate sectoral strategies and objectives, and for these to be regionally implemented by competent bodies. However, the current dual-reporting system for SEREMI - to ministries and Intendentes - may be generating inefficiencies and reducing programme effectiveness across the territory.\",\"Effective public investment requires substantial co-ordination across levels of government to bridge information, policy or fiscal gaps that may occur, as well as critical governance capacities at different levels to design and implement public investment projects. An Implementation Toolkit provides guidance with details for all countries (www.oecd.ore\\u002feffective-public-investment-toolkit). However, FDI inflows have been lower in the Philippines than in all other countries of the Southeast Asian region.\",\"The authorities need therefore to look for solutions that secure investments into public transport infrastructure and vehicles and keep the ticket fares at an affordable level. This would be important for all cities, however, it may be of particular importance for cities, where the proportion of public transport in comparison to car use is still negligible. To balance the needs for economic and social sustainability, cities have tried setting fares for cost-recovery and offering targeted subsidies for specific segments of the population.\",\"However, this rate of population growth has since slowed. Beyond this, it is also noted that since 2010, spatial planning has “lost its unitary institutional identity by having competencies for spatial planning, housing and nature management divided across three ministries” (Savini, 2013: 340). Gone are the days of large-scale national investments in such areas as housing, which were highly formative in shaping urban environments in decades past - particularly during periods of post war reconstruction and population growth.\",\"Their share of overall population grew from 18.2% in 1999 to 23.1% in 2009. Their population increased, on average, by 3.1% a year between 1999 and 2009. This was much higher than the average growth rate of metropolitan areas in OECD countries (0.86%) during the same period. In contrast, the average annual growth rate of population in medium-size and small FUAs was only slightly higher than in OECD countries during the same period.\",\"Main Economic Indicators (database), http:\\u002f\\u002fdx.doi.org\\u002f10.1787\\u002fcbcc2905-en. This is much higher than both Russia (86%) and EU countries, where owner-occupied housing accounted for 71% of the housing stock (Amann, 2013). This suggests Kazakhstan’s rental market is underdeveloped, and that much renting is informal and undocumented, with no rental contracts and often no registration (propiska) of tenants. Among Kazakhstan’s large cities (i.e. core cities of the 26 FUAs), only Astana seems to have a significant rental market (26%) (Figure 1.21).\",\"To a lesser extent, overall disparity is growing between urban and rural areas, notably in three of the country’s six regions (Nord-Ouest, Centre-Ouest and Sud). This assumes that the government will maintain macroeconomic stability and tackle corruption. Growth will mainly be driven by strong performances in the industry and services sectors, and also by public infrastructure investment and other investments in priority sectors.\",\"Finally, 16% of experts believe that greater use of AVs will have a negligible impact on overall vehicle use because other modes will adopt automation technologies in order to compete with AVs, thus offsetting the growth potential of the private use of AVs. The top barriers to the uptake of autonomous cars that experts identified include safety and security issues, technological challenges, and legislation and regulatory issues. Of the electric vehicle (EV) fleet, full-battery EVs are expected to comprise the highest share of vehicles by 2050.\",\"Agricultural production for processed and formally marketed food is highly concentrated. A secure institutional framework is critical to keep transaction costs low, lower barriers to entry, and provide certainty on the ties between farmers and agri-businesses (Sautier et al., Housing is a major source of wealth creation and savings, with investments accounting for 6 per cent of GDP, and for each house built, five jobs can be created (World Bank, 2015).\",\"In order to strengthen Metrolinx’s role in regional co-ordination, access to additional revenue sources could be considered. Metrolinx is required to come up with an Investment Strategy by 2013 to fund the balance of the Regional Transportation Plan, various additional revenue sources could be considered as part of the development of this investment strategy. The coverage of urban public transport operating costs by fare box revenues varies greatly in OECD countries (Figure 2.4). The definition of cost categories is not uniform across countries, which makes comparisons risky, but in the majority of operations, cost-coverage levels vary between one-third and two-thirds.\",\"Citizens can receive important information influencing their daily decisions. Conversely, cities can use the Internet to give a voice and listen to their inhabitants through online platforms for citizen participation, electronic voting, online surveys and social networks. Active involvement may in turn may influence the decision-making of municipal governments and enhance the city's democratic processes. For example, Toronto is engaging its citizens through the TransformTO project which invites residents and businesses to imagine the transformative changes needed to create a more prosperous, healthy, equitable and sustainable city (City of Toronto, 20166). Knowledge cities need to make communication fully interactive, rather than just two-way, to result in a win-win beneficial relationship.\",\"This section addresses the challenges and needs of persons with disabilities by providing the international normative frameworks pertaining to inclusive cities and human settlements and examines available national policies and best practices. The experience of persons with disabilities in urban and rural settings is also analysed in order to identify targeted actions to achieve Goal 11 in both settings. The resilience aspect is discussed in the section on hazards, shocks and disasters (targets 1.5 and 11.5 and Goal 13).\",\"The metropolitan government lias developed the Buildable Lands Inventory, a detailed and sophisticated land-monitoring process to inventory vacant land and track the “refill rate”. This is defined as the rate at which new development occurs through \\\"infill” (when more units are constructed on an already developed lot) or “redevelopment” (when a structure is removed and another built in its place). For nonindustrial use, 52% of new capacity was built on developed land (Metro, 2009).\",\"The rapid urban expansion has increased the city’s exposure to flooding, as people are settling and building in flood-prone areas (Tarigan et al., The northern half of Bandung, encompassing territory in four of the BMA's five local government units (LGUs), has been the focus of intense and uncoordinated development pressure (ibid). The impact of these new population centres in undesirable geographical locations in the north may increase the risk of flooding in southern parts of the city.\",\"As in the case of BRT schemes, authorities have negotiated with incumbent operators to annul individual concessions in exchange for giving priority in granting new concessions to enterprises formed by these incumbent operators. While no smart card has yet been introduced, buses acquired by concessionaires are required to be prepared for introducing this technology in the near future. The BRS corridors introduced to date are Valenciana-Tacubaya, Chapultepec-Palmas and Pefion-Panteon San Isidro. The price of the service is MXN 7 (USD 0.5).\",\"Promoting dense and proximate development patterns, diversifying land use and integrating investment in public transport and private urban development could usefully be explored. Higher residential densities can increase the cost-effectiveness of public transport by providing greater demand. Stockholm County has a few areas of high density (over 5 000 persons per square kilometre) as well as widely dispersed urban areas of low and medium density (Figure 2.1).\",\"The partnership came about because of two important factors. The first was a common interest in strengthening tourism by co-ordinating the historic and cultural offer of the city with the nature-based and agricultural tourism of the hinterland. The second factor was the role of the Liibeck Bay Regionen Aktiv programme in establishing a way for the individual rural municipalities to form a common association that had shared values and that could act as an agent when discussing options for partnering with the city. By aggregating the individual municipalities into a single unit, the two populations were more equal in size and the negotiations could take place with the rural municipalities having already agreed on a single strategy.\",\"The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) also adopted the Paris Agreement, through which United Nations Member States committed to limiting global warming, which implies a critical role for national governments in climate-change adaptation and mitigation in urban settlements, which are most responsible for and most vulnerable to climate change. Lastly, in October 2016, the Third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) adopted the New Urban Agenda (NUA), advocating for proactive policies to leverage the dynamics of urbanisation as instruments of sustainable development. Well-designed national policy frameworks can help countries and cities achieve economic growth, environmental sustainability and social inclusion.\",\"Although these type of projects have not disappeared, they have significantly decreased. Instead, the projects are progressively devoted to general and qualitative goals, such as the welfare of citizens, the quality of employment, efficiency of firms and sustainable development (OECD 2007). For instance, the State-Region Contracts 2015-2020 have five priorities for which 30 billion EUR will be made available: transport, higher education, digitalisation, innovation and ecological and energy transition (Charbit and Romano, 2017(n]).\",\"Operational integration and scheduling should facilitate transfer with minimum time wasted between modes. Such intermodal transfer facilities ensure easy transfer between urban transport modes, including active modes such as walking and cycling. Such intermodal transit stations need to be accessible via walkways, cycle paths and parking facilities for bicycles available nearby.\",\"The gridded population data used in this first step is from the Landscan project developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee (United States). Core municipalities corresponding to these city cores are identified. Municipalities sending 15% of their resident employed population or more to the core are included in the commuting zones, which thus can be defined as the “worker catchment area” of the uiban labour market, outside the densely inhabited core. The size of the commuting zones relative to the size of the core give a clear indication of cities’ influence on surrounding areas.\",\"The remaining urban growth will play out almost entirely in developing countries. In 100 years, it is likely to be three times larger. Moreover, as Angel (2012) shows, the historical pattern of urban growth suggests that over this time horizon, urban population density in developing cities could easily fall by half. One is to have a threefold increase in the average population of its existing cities and a sixfold increase in their average built area.\",\"Mukdahan has experienced a lesser spatial reorganisation in comparison to its partner, Savannakhet. Third, smart trade would benefit from further administrative collaboration, especially given the cultural connections across the border. The two cities are close to each other along the Mekong river and the Thai-Lao border with an increasingly consistent infrastructure network and new urban facilities. Smart trade can facilitate cross-border transportation between border cities (cont.)\",\"Based on the results of the metadata survey and the Pilot survey undertook in 2017 UIS is designing a detailed global data collection tool that matches the needs of the indicator. The 180 cities from 72 countries that currently make up this network work together towards a common objective: placing creativity and cultural industries at the heart of their development plans at the local level and cooperating actively internationally. The report looks at the contribution of culture to urban sustainability, and the promotion of a culture-based approach to urban planning.\",\"The misalignment of fund allocation with transit-oriented development is evident, for example, in the fact that investment in road infrastructure between 2004 and 2013 for the business and commercial district of Santa Fe was double the cost of installing the five lines of Metrobus (Medina, 2014). As a result, projects are limited by the lack of physical and operational complementarity, and they cannot benefit from shared knowledge and good practices. Both the regulatory framew'ork for Metrobus and Mexibus and the financial schemes for implementing corridors are significantly different.31 Segmented implementation limits knowledge sharing and harmonisation of quality.\",\"Kick-starting collaborative initiatives around tangible projects on key public services can help rally forces at the initial stage and progressively lead to setting a “bigger picture”, as success breeds further success and trust (OECD, 2015a). Flagship projects or events can also serve as catalysts for social change and stakeholder engagement. For example, the Capital of Culture experience in Marseille brought the society together in an unprecedented way. In a context of extremely high institutional fragmentation, this project laid a major foundation for the construction of the new metropolitan authority, which became operational on 1 January' 2016 (Box 5.16).\",\"It is for public authorities to adapt these operational enabiers to their respective circumstances. When implemented, these enabiers result in better outcomes for patterns of land use, inequality reduction, and improvements in urban form, increasing compactness and walkability. Together, these seven enabiers are “how\\\" in this process.\",\"Electric rickshaws are also gaining popularity for paratransit in Nepal (figure 4.10). Hanoi has a fleet of electric vehicles available for hire to tour core city area in Hanoi (figure 4.11). Therefore, it is necessary for Governments to simultaneously encourage adoption and boost infrastructure while providing incentives that support, embrace and encourage private investors.\",\"Prices should also incentivise behaviour in line with policy objectives promoting the use of public and non-motorised transport. Efficient parking pricing is a highly effective tool. In San Francisco, smart parking meters with real-time fare adjustments have increased the effectiveness of variable-rate on-street parking pricing.\",\"In particular, the creation of the “MP2013” label (Marseille Provence 2013) through the creation of an association at the metropolitan scale was a key building block and helped develop collaborative projects that reached beyond initial cultural objectives to such areas as uiban transport, environment and economic development. The results of the European Capital of Culture 2013 largely exceeded initial expectations, with more than 10 million visitors and around EUR 600 million estimated economic spillover effects. In December 2006, an association “Marseille Provence 2013” was set up and the project w’as selected by a European juty in September 2008. The association MP2013 covers 97 municipalities, mainly from the 6 inter-municipal authorities (etablissements publics de cooperation intercommunale).\",\"Figure 3.4 plots a regional comparison of km of road per 100 km2 and km of road per 1,000 inhabitants.

Sweden has the highest road density (56 km of roads per 1,000 inhabitants), followed by Estonia (41 km per 1,000 inhabitants) and Iceland (39 km per 1,000 inhabitants).\",\"Chungcheongnam-do and Jeju-do have benefitted from overall population growth. In the 15 years between 2000 and 2015, metropolitan areas, defined as functional urban areas with 500 000 - 1.5 million residents, experienced the fastest population growth with an approximately 18% increase, on average, over the period. Large metropolitan and medium-sized urban areas grew by 9% and 7%.\",\"Such ordinances are valid for a ten-year period. Compared to land-use plans, management ordinances have the advantage that they can be prepared more quickly and cheaply, but they do not create a legal basis for development. Amsterdam’s land price policy is updated by the annual land prices Letter of Land and Development City of Amsterdam and the Land Pricing Guide. The letter outlines macroeconomic trends and their policy implications.\",\"The programme’s design emphasises interaction among various sectors and has helped build social capital and social networks that can be used to move other projects forward at the public sector and community levels. Yet, crosssector\\u002finter-institutional interaction has been scarce. Clear and complementary roles for other sector institutions like the MTT, the MOP, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development and the Regional Governments should be established.\",\"Two reasons could be considered. The first is related to project management. Bureaucratic red-tapes, poor co-ordination across relevant authorities, and financial conditions may lead to project delays and thus keep reclaimed land vacant. Such issues have in the past created problems for LGUs, investors and designated government agencies that had financed the reclamation project through loans and were liable for repayment (Dacayo, 2005).\",\"Making all information and references about green growth freely available among all public government officials would be an important first step. Offering more training opportunities for young, mid-level and technical officials in cities would also be an effective option. Training programmes specifically tailored to these targeted officials should also be developed. In Viet Nam, General Statistics Office (GSO) is the central government's agency responsible for the national census and official statistics for all cities and provinces.7 While the Vietnamese official statistics currently measures 11 sectors, consisting of more than 200 indicators,8 these indicators measure mostly the economic performance of the sectors, with less regards to its environmental or social impacts. For example, the agriculture sector has 46 indicators that measure area of farming, quantity of outputs, and crop yield, but they do not contain indicators that measure agriculture waste, energy consumption or GHG emissions.\",\"Of course, it is not guaranteed that every organisation w'hich deals with at least two different issues addresses the complexities of metropolitan area governance in a meaningful way. Nevertheless, the distinction between organisations that focus on one issue and organisations that focus on many issues is an operationally useful and objective w'ay to identify organisations that work across individual policy fields. The national government reintroduced municipalities as the basic building block of subnational government in 1990 as part of the process of restoring democratically elected governments. Municipalities were given significant responsibility for local administration and planning, with each municipality having independence from oversight by other municipalities.\",\"Collaboration at local and higher levels of government involves the promotion of common structural changes, leading to new types of investment and spatial administration for new trade procedures and promotion (Arnold, 2010). They are connected through an infrastructure network, have potential for deep economic interdependency, and have implemented policies to facilitate trade and investment and increase business opportunities. The two cities are also part of a growing transport network within the East-West Economic Corridor (EWEC) connecting the cities across the border.\",\"In turn, this leads to dead-weight efficiency losses for the local and national economy. As a result, governments may be better placed than markets to determine to best quantity to be provided. Spatial plans are a useful mechanism for managing environmental quality because they inherently capture where actions that affect the environment occur, and the parcels of land that experience the consequences of these actions. Where the spill over effects are externalities there can be additional reasons for relying on government to manage the level of environmental effects that have no market price.\",\"In the words of McCann, “scale is not a neutral background, rather, it is a discursive frame used by competing interests to define or redefine the appropriate location of political pow er and the territorial extent of specific policies and regulation” (McCann, 2003: 160). In the words of Petitet, “the question is therefore how' to turn the virtuous general objectives at the (inter) SCoT level into real and specific building regulations at a more local level and how' to ensure that these higher level objectives are respected at the most local level” (2010: 48). Asymmetries or imbalances between the capabilities of those involved can frustrate the process: “not all areas have the same ability to impact spatial planning projects” (Bertrand, 2015).\",\"The approval process for local-level planning instruments (e.g. PLADECO, PRC) is not structured to accommodate an integrated urban programme, as it evaluates projects individually. This leads to a possibility of approving initiatives that are more aligned to national or regional priorities than those that are critical to meeting local needs. In this sense, Antofagasta’s planning is at risk of being captured by the approval process.\",\"In 2013, there were 736 places per 1,000 pupils in urban settlements and 537 places per 1,000 pupils in rural settlements. There are no separate statistics for urban and rural settlements regarding theatres, concert halls, museums, zoos and circuses but, in general, they have been maintained at the same or slightly higher levels. Much effort has also been put into developing an integrated infrastructure for the elderly, disabled and other vulnerable groups. These specific services include advisory and information services, material and financial support, temporary shelter, social welfare institutions and housekeeping services.\",\"Waste collection services often do not reach all residents and landfills remain the preferred treatment method. Many Southeast Asian cities have also experienced increasing water demand and situations of water stress and scarcity, aggravated by the poor coverage and quality of water supply infrastructure. Water sanitation infrastructure is also sub-optimal and has not kept up with the pace of urbanisation, and the quality of water streams and bodies is often under established quality standards. In many Southeast Asia cities, informal services and infrastructure have compensated for the absence of formal structures.\",\"Cities create wealth, generate employment and drive human progress by harnessing the forces of agglomeration and industrialization.8 Cites also offer greater societal freedoms. In the process of urbanization, however, there have been some bumps along the road, many of which are discussed in Chapters 3 to 8. While it is easy to ascribe all these changes to urbanization, such a causal connection would be superficial. The model is a result of relentless globalization, the unfettered transformation of cities into sources of private gain, a declining attention to public space and community benefit, and rapid technological change which in the end increases connectivity while it diminishes accountability.\",\"Faithful implementation of policies and programmes in these areas outlined by the president will be crucial in addressing Tanzania’s poverty problem in the medium term. In the city of Dar-es-Salaam and other major cities, unemployment is higher than in the rural areas, basic infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, bus transit, etc.) Planned residential areas are rare, although land itself is in abundance. Intra-city transportation presents a serious challenge to commuters due to poor road networks and the absence of intra-city mass rail transport systems.\",\"Technology can help rural residents provide and access information about service quality' and about alternative providers. Geolocation facilitates matching between the supply of and demand for services. Renewable energy can reduce “fuel poverty” that can be a common feature of remote regions, by allowing isolated communities to produce their own energy instead of importing expensive conventional fuels.\",\"In this light policies to promote balanced development should not neglect primary cities because they are at the crux of economic innovation and growth. Policymakers should therefore tailor location-based industrial policies to the needs of targeted sectors and firms. Thus governments should foster these advantages by supporting knowledge-based institutions and mechanisms for knowledge sharing between firms of different sizes and sectors in large cities.\",\"However, responsibilities are often not well defined and incomplete, therefore limiting local actions. Taking down a tree requires the approval of the national government, for instance. As a result of the lack of a clear national policy framew'ork and w'ell-defmed responsibilities, LGUs have taken some critical responsibilities in the management of urban utilities, such as water supply, without efficient legislative framework.\",\"Box 3.2 outlines the institutional framew'ork of mobility policy in each state-level entity of the ZMVM. This section describes the main challenges for state-level institutions in charge of mobility in aligning policies with sustainable and inclusive mobility goals. The Ministiy of Housing and Urban Development (SEDUVI) runs the ecoParq programme for on-street parking fees.\",\"However, in some cases a monetary evaluation of the values related to natural and cultural heritage may be beneficial and provide information that could stimulate balanced discussions about the options at hand, for instance regarding future land use and allocation of both public and private funding. The concept of ecosystem services is only emerging but has proved to be useful in this regard, in parallel to valuation methods focusing especially on cultural heritage.\",\"Planned City Extensions can prevent the leap-frogging over vast areas that generates wasteful and speculative areas within the city and results in prohibitive costs for urban services and infrastructure provision in distant places. When deployed next to existing neighbourhoods, these planned extensions offer urban dwellers the possibility to live, work, rest and play in close proximity to consolidated urban areas. This first lever of change contributes to more efficient and sustainable development patterns steering urban expansion towards areas that are more suited for positive urbanization.\",\"Property tax systems in many OECD countries favour single-family homes over multi-occupancy dwellings (thus stimulating urban sprawl) or owner-occupied housing over rental accommodation (thus reducing labour mobility). Such tax arrangements coexist w'ith national and city-level policies intended to curb urban sprawl and improve labour market efficiency. National housing strategies tend to stimulate the housing supply, via direct spending to support new housing construction or facilitate access to home ownership, regulatory tools (e.g. to require municipalities to build social housing as in France) or tax incentives (e.g. deductible interest on mortgage in the United States), for example.\",\"Together, the partnering authorities managed a USD 3.5 million US Department of Housing and Urban Development Sustainable Development regional planning grant towards planning initiatives building inclusive economic opportunities, using the regional public transport network, as well as supporting affordable housing development in the region. Projects submitted by the consortium include the development of Metro North commuter rail in the Bronx Corridor in New York City to encourage investments in lower income communities along the rail lines, and in the Nassau Hub Transit Area along the Long Island Rail Road System. In Stamford, Connecticut, the consortium contemplated the construction of a new commuter rail station.\",\"The consolidated city of Changw'on started building a second Anmin tunnel at the end of 2016. The previous cities of Changw'on and Masan are connected through a congested general road and a bridge (Machang bridge, built in 2008). This bridge reduced the travel time from 35 minutes to just 7 minutes between the two cities. The construction of the bridge was privately financed (Hw'ang, 2016). Transit-oriented development: The Plan 2030 proposes a package of measures, including networking of railways (trunk line) and buses (feeder line). The city government negotiated with national and regional authorities to obtain intergovernmental grants for the construction of two subway lines, but its request w'as turned down due to low economic feasibility.\",\"Some of the River Basin Authorities integrate intra-regional stakeholders, others function inter-regionally, which increases the complexity and the risk for tension among the various stakeholders.

While the Strategic Environmental Evaluations (EAEs) are intended to take into account the impact of PRs and other regional plans on ecosystems, in practice, the EAEs have not yet had much effect on mitigating the potential impact of urban expansion on biodiversity.\",\"For instance, in 2007, the General Directorate for Water (Direccion General de Aguas, DGA) and the Regional Environmental Commission (Comision Regional del Medio Ambiente, COREMA), rejected an environmental impact assessment of a plan by one mining company to extract additional groundwater from aquifers in the Pampa Colorada area in San Pedro de Atacama. The plan had generated considerable protests from indigenous communities over the potential impact on local wetlands (Larrain and Schaeffer, 2010). With copper prices at a historic high, it is reasonable to assume that mining activities in Antofagasta will continue to expand in the near future (Trading Economics, 2013).\",\"Two examples of such ambitious national policies, in France and in the United States, offer particularly interesting insights (Box 5.6). At city level, innovative approaches can also help pursue co-ordinated investments in housing and other sectors (such as mobility, basic services, public spaces, public safety and green areas), based on local institutional and financial partnerships. The experience of Santiago de Chile provides a compelling illustration in this sense (Box 5.7). Maximising accessibility for all thus needs to be at the core of urban transport planning. Disadvantaged communities often have less well-maintained infrastructure - notably roads, lesser access to reliable public transport services, and are less likely to own a private car.\",\"All new large-scale projects with total costs of at least KRW 50 billion (about USD 47.5 million) are subject to a PFS (save for a few' exceptions). Line ministries are required to submit a project proposal to the MOSF two years before the project. The procedure is organised in three phases, based on interactions between the line ministry, the MOSF and PIMAC: 1) the line ministry selects PFS candidate projects and submits them to the MOSF, which selects projects in consultation with a PFS committee, 2) PIMAC conducts the PFS (through a team composed of external and internal experts), 3) the MOSF makes the investment decision.\",\"It begins with an assessment of the main challenges of the current system of inter-governmental relations and offers possible alternatives to improve co-ordination across levels of government and among national policy actors. It also explores local government finance and the way the current arrangements for managing local public finance act in detriment of urban development. It formulates some recommendations to ensure that local governments have access to resources to pay for urbanisation. The chapter proposes some recommendations for strengthening civil service reform with a particular focus on subnational levels of government.\",\"To obtain registration at a given address within a city, internal migrants must provide evidence of ownership (property title to real estate) or a tenancy agreement and the consent of the real estate owner in written form. In practice, landowners most often do not want to be involved in the formal registration of their tenants (the rental market in Kazakhstan’s cities is largely informal). Migrants living in informal housing units (i.e. homes not included in the state real estate registry) are also not able to register because they cannot provide a valid address. Sometimes they remain registered in their previous place of residence (usually small cities in the countryside).\",\"Although the 1988 Local Finance Act was amended several times (in 2005, 2009 and 2011) to enhance fiscal decentralisation, subnational governments in Korea still depend heavily on central government transfers. In 2013, the share of central government in total subnational government revenue in Korea remained well above the OECD average (61.6% vs. 37.3%) (Figure 1.22 and Box 1.8). According to the Act on the Management of Grants, the national government provides grants to cover part or all of the costs of traffic-related investments in cities and provinces.\",\"Unequal access to, and inefficient use of, public services, as well as financial fragility and the harm inflicted by natural hazards, demand an integrated and coordinated response at the local, national and international levels. Ensuring wider and inclusive access to public services can reduce rural\\u002furban inequalities, disaster risk and food insecurity, as well as strengthen networks between cities and villages. Cities in poor countries need resources to support green technology transfer, and capacity development, and to improve access to soundly constructed housing, water and sanitation, electricity, health and education.\",\"In Turin, Italy, when such an assessment was undertaken it came to light that one building segment, multifamily, high-rise buildings constructed before 1980 accounted for more than 70% of total residential floor area and about 70% of total energy consumption for heating (IEA, 2016a). This information allowed for better targeted energy saving measures. Also, In Paris, an energy information advisor has been providing support to building pennit applicants for energy saving projects since 2008 covering issues on sustainable building renovation (Maine de Paris, 2012).\",\"For example, about 70 per cent of the bus fleets in 2003 needed major repairs or scrapping. As a result of government actions, the number of buses in operation for up to three years has increased, accounting for 44 per cent of the fleet in 2014 (compared with 18 per cent a decade ago). Furthermore, modern automated control systems for municipal and regional public transport routes have also being installed, including passenger counting, payment control, and fuel and lubricant usage control systems. In 2011, three in every four journeys were made using public transport - on average, 240 journeys per person per year.\",\"A study of the city of Toronto and its metropolitan area conducted in 2005 gives an idea of the costs that congestion can produce (OECD, 2010b). The average commuting time in Toronto was one of the highest among metropolitan regions in the OECD, with congestion imposing costs estimated at CAD 2.7 billion per year. In particular, it focuses on the development of efficient public transportation systems, implementing pricing and other mechanisms for affecting vehicle ownership and use, incorporating new technologies in managing transportation challenges, adopting new modes of work, and reforming land use and urban planning. The development of bus and rail networks can therefore play an important role in reducing traffic congestion.\",\"Other regional actors, such as associations and firms, also play a notable role in the process of preparing the regional strategic plan.

New housing development should be compact and transport-oriented, using a mix of densification and brownfield development to control sprawl (OECD, 2017, forthcoming). It is a means of using the planning system to create affordable housing.\",\"The only exceptions in an OECD survey on water governance in cities are Hong Kong, China, Lisbon, Portugal, and the Federal District of Mexico. Similarly, hospitals and schools tend to reduce their water consumption. While per capita water consumption initially dropped due to reduced outdoor use, indoor water use (chiefly through low-flow toilets and efficient washing machines) has also decreased. These households usually remain connected to the main infrastructure, and in some cases discharge water they have not purchased into the sewer, free-riding on the sewer service.\",\"Land-use policy must be applied across the entire BMA, as risks are also incurred by a lack of inter-governmental co-ordination on hazard mitigation planning. Although a general master plan for the BMA has been prepared by the provincial government, no effective land-use plan has been set up. The delivery of building permits in different local government areas in north of Bandung, for example, is at cross purposes with hazard reduction efforts at a metropolitan scale (Hudalah et al., The BMA should draw up a metropolitan spatial land use plan binding the local governments.

However, in recent years, the economic and social benefits that cultural heritages offer to cities across the world are increasingly recognized as keys for sustainable development. There is an emphasis on participatory and collective practices that aim to achieve inclusivity. As culture is a locally specific goal, local governments are important actors between global and regional development forces, and citizens.

For many cities, there are few sidewalks and pedestrians have to share crowded roads with motorized traffic. Although cycling may be relatively inexpensive, it is often difficult and potentially dangerous, with few cycleways or lanes.\",\"A national programme should be started to support citizens’ use of renewable energy (primarily solar) by, for example, providing subsidies for solar panel and battery purchase. Equipping the housing stock with communal heat metering instniments will make people accountable for their actual consumption and improve the financial resilience of heat providers. Actual heat consumption data will encourage energy-saving measures in housing. To this end, there will need to establish a programme for targeted assistance with utility payments and funds targeted from the national budget.\",\"The Thai government and international partners have provided assistance to train and share knowledge with local governments, but their capacity could be further developed, including results-based monitoring and evaluation systems. The BMA has developed key performance indicators (KPIs), but no such mechanism exists at the level of the BMR. Similarly, data is not consistently produced at the scale of the BMR.\",\"The second is related to the quality of urban development. It is observed that some reclamation project sites are yet to be fully integrated into existing urban systems. While strategic location of reclaimed land demonstrates potential, isolated reclaimed areas with monotonous land use and poor public transport accessibility may significantly lose the attractiveness of the areas for investors.\",\"In this case, the Seoul metropolitan government also collaborated with private partners under a public-private partnership structure to provide public transport (Pucher et al., Revenue is deposited in a trust fund, which in turn proceeds payment for the agents on a weekly basis. This revenue and other charges pursuant to the concession contract contribute to 4% of the system’s budget. The city-owned company that oversees the project, TransMilenio S.A., functioned thanks to city subsidies until 2003.\",\"An estimated 80% of communes have less than 1 000 residents. Consolidation of the large number of communes into fewer and larger basic units of local government has been politically rejected—amalgamations have been rare. In part this may reflect the dual role of national legislatures who, perhaps more than is the case in other countries, understand the importance local populations have for direct democracy at a scale that is meaningful. The OECD has recommended that France reduce the number of communes by merging the smallest ones in order to achieve economies of scale and to pool resources effectively (OECD, 2014, 2013, 2011). However, absent such aggregation, the only option in an environment where the basic unit of government is too small, is to find ways to encourage collaboration. Because of this, communes frequently enter into voluntary associations with each other in order to co-deliver services and share elements of administration—referred to as intercommunalites.\",\"Although bike share operators provide guidelines regarding best practices for parking (e.g. avoiding locations that block pedestrian travel), there are generally no penalty mechanisms by which good parking practices can be enforced. The question of who is entitled to the rights to the data generated by these systems also constitutes a novel issue for policymakers. If made available to researchers, for example, this type of data could be used for public transport blind spot analyses, biking hotspot analysis and prediction, multimode transportation analysis, and lifestyle impact analysis. Increasing mode shares of cyclists in cities also has implications for safety (ITF, 2018a), and may also necessitate infrastructure changes, such as reducing car lanes and increasing bike lanes.\",\"Globalisation has led to a loss of jobs - especially in the manufacturing sector - and this has been amplified by the economic crisis. Many cities, especially non-capital cities in Central and Eastern Europe, but also old industrial cities in Western Europe, face the serious threat of economic stagnation or decline. Our economies in their current form are unable to provide jobs for all.\",\"Accelerating investment in public transport is the backbone of all urban green growth strategies. However, given the demand for travel and the increasing dependency on automobiles, a multidimensional approach and policy alignment across governments are crucial. A number of specific RE technologies show particular potential for development. Meanwhile, the Thai government should continue to roll back fossil fuel subsidies and gradually increase the carbon tax on transport fuels and electricity, in proportion to their relative carbon intensity, to reflect their real cost to society.\",\"The RDP has been greatly influenced by the prevailing sectoral policy approach in the central government. Between 2011 and 2014, the RDP was transformed from an urban and regional development programme into a collection of specific sectoral policies that had already existed, such as: the “Programme for the Development of Single-Industry Towns”, “Modernisation of Housing and Communal Facilities 2011-2020”, “Ak Bulak programme 2011-2020”, and “Affordable Housing 2020 Programme”. These sectoral policies were put together as part of the RDP, without any preliminary assessment of their efficiency. For instance, until recently, the “Ak Bulak” programme focused exclusively on supplying drinking water and did not include any assessment of the possible impact of subjecting the sewage system to increasing volumes of water.\",\"Urbanization also requires a governance system that we hope and dream of as democratic, open, transparent and caring for the common interest, while respecting privacy. This is why urbanization is guided by policies and is governed by the principle of \\\"the rule of law\\\" being the most fundamental element of urbanization, as embraced in the New Urban Agenda. The achievement of a model of urbanization that induces prosperity and well-being demands a relative degree of participation and social consensus on the aim of enhancing the positive effects of urbanization.\",\"Consequently, states tend to define their policies to be consistent with the national government approach. To address this issue, the role of a body such as the State Council for Sustainable Rural Development (Consejo Estatal para el Desarollo Rural Sustentable, CEDERS) should be strengthened, for its mission is to facilitate cross-agency co-ordination and the participation of productive agents (e.g. farmers) in the definition of state priorities. The Regional Programme of Ecological Land Management reflects this well (Programa de Ordenamiento Ecologico Regional). The Regional Programme of Ecological Management has become the main instrument for managing land use in the state.\",\"These two high-level documents provide a lens through which to understand, but not necessarily to fully assess, the complexity of intergovernmental relations in the Gauteng city-region, for which primary research is necessary. These policies stem from the admission that despite gains in access to public services and quality of life, additional reforms are required to optimise performance. Quality and service standards have not always improved, despite massive increases in successive budgets.\",\"The NUA stresses the need to reduce urban-rural disparities, to foster equitable development across urban-rural areas, to encourage urban-rural interactions and connectivity. This can be done by strengthening transport, technology and communication networks and infrastructure, underpinned by planning instruments based on a territorial approach to maximize the potential of these sectors for enhanced productivity, social, economic, and territorial cohesion, and environmental sustainability. Collectively, the SDGs and NUA recognize the importance of rural and urban development in the planning process, the role of different actors in enhancing service delivery, and collective development in which no place and no one is left behind. Such policy guidance is attainable through national and regional development planning interventions that tend to reduce disparities and ensure a more harmonious development.\",\"Environmental monitoring systems are underfunded, and environmental statistics do not always reflect the current pollution load on the environment. Kazakhstan plans to decrease the use of coal in electricity production and rely more on gas-fuelled power plants and alternative energy sources, such as solar panels and wind farms. Municipal waste collection services do not yet cover the whole population. Often municipal solid waste is dumped in sites with few, if any, engineered environmental protection systems, creating significant risks for ground water and the environment.\",\"Looking across the OECD, sub-national governments manage around 72% of direct public investment - with notable variation among countries. If well managed, public investment represents a potentially growth-enhancing form of public expenditure. However, poor investment choices and implementation not only waste limited public resources and erode public trust, but they may also hamper future growth opportunities. Invest using an integrated strategy tailored to different places.\",\"The signing of the NAFTA agreement in 1992, which came into force in 1994, allowed the Toronto region to integrate into a wider and cross-border regional manufacturing system, and stable fiscal and macro-economic policies have sustained its relatively low business costs. Federal immigration policies have encouraged a steady inflow of highly skilled labour into Canada. This has sustained the Toronto region’s economy, which is heavily integrated with the United States, thanks to its proximity to US markets.\",\"The SEIA can only require mitigation, repair or compensation for environmental damage. The Environmental Evaluation Service does not have the mandate to consider the larger urban system in assessing a project’s environmental impact (SEA, 2012). The result is case-by-case treatment of environmental externalities that does not consider how each effort at mitigation, repair or compensation may undermine or contribute to an urban area’s overall environmental quality. One mechanism that has been developed is the Urban Transport System Impact Study (Estudio de Impacto al Sistema de Transporte Urbano\\u002fEISTU), which sets conditions to mitigate a development’s potential impact on roadways and parking for large projects (SST, n.d.).\",\"All these agendas have strong linkages with SDG 11 - providing a means for financing urban development (Addis Agenda), addressing a wide range of actions necessary for making cities spatially effective for sustainable development (NUA), providing a framework for disaster risk management, prevention and reduction and resilience strengthening including urban resilience (Sendai Framework), and focusing on climate actions that include urbanization-related activities (Paris Agreement). It is also important to note that the linkages and connections between agendas and various targets can be both positive and negative, and hence these relationships versus desired outcomes or impacts need proper identification, analysis and mitigation of any associated risks. These partnerships seek to provide technical and operational guidance for post-disaster city reconstruction and recovery programmes and for assessing capacity at the national level for DRR in the culture sector.\",\"The metropolitan municipality, as the sole local government in such provinces, took on the local government services for the entire province. It is responsible for rural and urban administration, and 77% of the total national population lives within the metropolitan boundaries. Technically and for economies of scale, it is necessaiy to plan and manage the services for the entire uiban space.\",\"And commercial development in suburban locations can often impact on the economic strategies of the city. The city hinterland also supplies essential services, such as the supply of food and drinking water, flood management, and waste disposal. So, city governments need to take an interest in land outside the city boundary' - if possible to deter urban sprawl, development that may increase flood risk and the need for transport infrastructure. Equally, local governments outside the city need to reflect how the development of the urban area will place demands on their plans and land use. David Audretsch’s book, Everything in its Place, sets out a framework for strategic management of growth in a place-based approach, but across multiple places, big and small, how' can development planning help to avoid unwarranted externalities and thus achieve the best overall outcome in use of land? How could the national need for sufficient new homes be reflected in the totality of local plans, while (reflecting the views of those who elected them) local planning authorities were reluctant to designate sufficient land to deliver a “fair share”?\",\"Western Scandinavia features two successful examples of such packages, in Oslo and in West Sweden (see the summary in Table 2.7 and a description in Box 2.9). Both political agreements allow for substantial national investment in urban transport infrastructure under the condition that the metropolitan areas create a new tax or a charge (a ring road toll in Oslo, congestion tax in Gothenburg) and use the revenue to match national funding. City packages are long-term plans for the development of transport systems in a city or in a metropolitan area (typically over a period of 20 years), which are co-fiinded with road tolls.\",\"Green belts have been implemented across the OECD, albeit with decidedly mixed results: as part of national urban policy in the United Kingdom or national spatial planning in the Netherlands, as well as around numerous cities, including Vienna, Barcelona, Budapest, Berlin, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, Toronto, Vancouver, Chicago, Sydney, and Melbourne (Kamal-Chaoui and Sanchez-Reaza, 2012). In both Japan and Korea, the national government defines zoning categories for municipalities that orient the form and intensity of local land uses, in Korea, for instance, zoning reform in 2008 included revisions to encourage mixed-use and transit-oriented development (OECD, 2012a). A global survey of planning practices in the mid-2000s found almost universal acceptance of comprehensive master planning or its equivalent (Friedmann, 2005). Typically, cities are mandated by national governments to produce master plans that specify future land uses and circulation patterns.\",\"These gravitation effects are often difficult to quantify, and in order to detect any significant trends the phenomenon has to be monitored for longer time periods. Likewise, different type of counteracting effects should be considered, like the cost of wear and tear, and the need for investments in infrastructure. To conclude, the authors were critical towards some of the simplified interpretations of economic impact studies, but still argued that such studies are needed. However, these studies should take account of all effects, both positive and negative effects on regional economies, include comparative analyses (i.e. what would have been the effects of alternative investments), and also explicitly specify the type of financing allocated to the project under consideration.\",\"This urbanization trend combined with the overall growth of the world's population could add another 2.5 billion people to the urban population by 2050. This means that a rapid increase in urban solid waste generation will take place. As urbanization and population growth will continue, it is expected that solid waste generation will double by 2025.\",\"Taxes of this kind are however easier to implement than a congestion charge, because they require no investment in a charging system. In combination with a parking tax, they could discourage car use. Parking fees and taxes are price-elastic, and there is ample evidence that they are effective in reducing car trips and decreasing the car share in the modal split.\",\"Financial incentives could assist owners to replace their vehicles with low emission vehicles or even electronic Jeepneys (e-jeepneys). Metro Cebu could set a target and support such transition. Globally, under the Urban Electric Mobility Initiative, city governments have pledged that electrical vehicles will account for 30% of light duty vehicles plying their cities by 2030 (UEMI, 2017).\",\"Since the adoption of the Programme of Action, which contains one of the most comprehensive negotiated texts on international migration to date, the issue of international migration and its relation to development has become increasingly prominent. The High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held in September 2006, was the first high-level meeting of the General Assembly exclusively dedicated to the topic. The Sustainable Development Goals include several migration-related targets, including one for the facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, while the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, in 2015, includes practical recommendations to strengthen the contribution of migration and remittances to development (see General Assembly resolution 69\\u002f313). In 2016, the Assembly decided to develop two global compacts, one on refugees and one for safe, orderly and regular migration, both to be adopted in 2018 (see Assembly resolution 71\\u002f1). Both urbanization and international migration are inextricably linked with the process of development.\",\"Private sector investments that target at-risk areas, due to the relatively low cost of land coupled by short-term gains to be made by business and local government officials, further binds informal settlers to this risky land given the new livelihood opportunities, maintaining or increasing disaster risk for these people. Actions beyond preparedness and response can be difficult to sell to local government due to the lack of quick and visible impacts, particularly in areas where officials do not tend to look beyond an election cycle. Lack of sufficient resources at local level compounds the problem.\",\"In Bangkok, policies to restrain the use of private cars were never implemented (although they were often proposed). In contrast, Tokyo has prevented car dependency with travel demand-management strategies. One of the most stringent is requiring buyers of cars to secure a night-time parking place before they are granted permission to register a car.\",\"By 2007, UCLG ed that local expenditures in Brazil were to 8.3 per cent of its GDP - the highest n Latin America. While it has waxed and waned in many countries as central governments have failed to fully relinquish financial control over municipalities even when directed to do so by legislation, cities have emerged with generally stronger financial tools than they had going into the period. But as their growth has continued to outpace their ability to provide services for their citizens, they have had to deal frontally with one of the central issues of the Habitat Agenda: the need to provide adequate housing, particularly for the poor.\",\"Gravity models, which estimate traffic flows between transport zones (determined by the Korea Transport Institute and similar to administrative TL4 areas), while accounting for local characteristics, should be used to estimate traffic volumes between the areas affected by the new infrastructure, including adjacent zones that are not directly affected. To account for expected changes from other projects, the constructor should review current national or regional plans for land use, transport, and industrial complexes. Based on these plans, the constructor should estimate the basic traffic volumes that are expected to result from the plans’ projects.\",\"The net annual profit from the ground lease is remitted to the central municipal budget (approximately 50%) and the reminder contributes to the balancing fund and social housing fund. There is a municipal policy that the ground lease is set at a lower value for social housing developments. As of 2015, there were 255 000 ground leases issued in the city.\",\"Besides, the definition has been applied to Colombia, where 54 FUAs have been identified (Sanchez-Serra, 2016). The new typology classifies TL3 regions into metropolitan if more than 50% of the regional population live in a FUA of at least 250 thousand inhabitants (and as Large metro TL3 region (MR-L), if more than 50% of its population lives in a FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants or Metro TL3 region (MR-M)), and non-metropolitan otherwise. Non-metropolitan TL3 regions (NMR) are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes into: With access to a metro TL3 region (NMR-M), With access to a small\\u002fmedium city TL3 region (NMR-S), and Remote TL3 region (NMR-R).\",\"Weakening links between economic growth, employment and social progress have pushed a larger share of the population out of the labour market or towards low-skilled and low-wage jobs in the service sector. Social polarisation and segregation are increasing. The recent economic crisis has further amplified the effects of market processes and the gradual retreat of the welfare state in most European countries.\",\"This effectively breaks the time-honoured link between civic rights and nationality. The political inclusion mandate is taken one step further with voter education and awareness campaigns. In Colombia, the government guarantees basic services - water supply, sanitation, electricity, waste collection, telephone and gas - to all, including slum-dwellers. These technological innovations have resulted in new urban landscapes that would have seemed too futuristic and only remotely possible nearly 20 years ago, during the Habitat II conference.\",\"There is only a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between MCDCB and LGUs, but not regulatory relationship. Because LGUs cannot afford a planning department staffed by professional planners, and therefore cannot fulfil the obligations to complete a CLUP, the impact of the support of MCDCB to prepare CLUPs has been limited so far. Also, the MCDCB has undertaken a strong branding and outreach programme, with brochures, videos and other tools.\",\"Making regulatory provisions for pilot projects and promoting innovation will therefore be key in fostering further AV development. Connected, autonomous, shared and electric mobility will be essential, and the shared nature of this mobility in particular will be essential to meeting mobility needs. Pilot projects regarding shared autonomous vehicles have sought to sequentially increase the complexity of the systems. Keolis, for example, currently operates 10 autonomous shuttles and has transported 90 000 passengers in seven countries.\",\"For example, key transport infrastructures influencing external connectivity, and thus exports, such as rail infrastructure, are under the jurisdiction of the federal Ministry of Transport, while other transport infrastructures that contribute to the same objective, such as regional roads, are under the responsibility of the Krai. Logistics infrastructure, also affecting the conditions for exports and cargo transit, is governed at the local level and financed partly by federal or private funds. Improving the conditions for exporting firms in the Agglomeration thus depends on aligning all levels of government and involved actors and stakeholders around this common goal, and on co-ordinating policies in an integrated framework that allows transport to be governed at the relevant territorial scale.\",\"Second, as the situation in one country began to improve, it attracted patients from neighbouring countries seeking unoccupied beds for treatment, thus reigniting transmission chains. In other words, as long as one country experienced intense transmission other countries remained at risk, no matter how strong their own response measures were. The traditional custom of returning, often over long distances, to a native village to die and be buried near ancestors is another dimension of population movement that carries an especially high transmission risk. In past outbreaks, Ebola was largely confined to remote rural areas, with just a few scattered cases detected in cities. In West Africa, cities - including the capitals of the three main Ebola affected countries, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - have been epicentres of intense virus transmission. The Ebola outbreaks in West Africa demonstrated how swiftly the virus could move once it reached urban settings and densely populated slums.\",\"Before the committee deals with the nominations, specialist non-government organisations (NGOs) assess them thoroughly to ensure that the convention’s requirements to quality, boundaries and administration are met. It means that the relevant country must commit itself to conserving the resources over a long term. The areas are monitored every sixth year to see whether the resources have deteriorated and whether changes are required in their management. Additional tourists can mean increased revenues, but at the same time the tourists can have a negative impact on the resources - for example through wear and tear.\",\"In Chile, the national government would do well to create a definition of natural-hazard zones, and to specify the conditions for development and types of land uses applicable to them. The primary risks in continental France are floods, landslides, avalanches, earthquakes and forest fires. The PPRn indicates at-risk zones, and either prohibits construction or allows it only under certain conditions.\",\"Hong Kong, China as well as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore have developed well-functioning integrated urban transportation systems that are based on attractive pub lie transport and restricted use of private vehicles. Country and city authorities could initiate policies to promote their use through providing tax rebates. Many guidelines,14 technical standards,15 case studies16 and sourcebooksl7 that focus on a particular aspect of urban transport and mobility are readily available.\",\"However, local governments have little financial autonomy and are still largely dependent on central government transfers for the implementation of policies and delivery of services. With the national policy goal of balanced national development, the Korean government has been fully committed to actual decentralisation and continued its efforts to realise it. Some value-added taxes are collected under the name of local consumption taxes to increase the tax revenue base of local municipalities.\",\"While public transportation is well patronised in Chile’s cities, some potential passengers may be deterred by the real or perceived impression that it is inefficient, unclean or unsafe. Chile’s public transport fare structure includes fare differentiation to improve service management (e.g. higher prices at peak hours) or to increase social equity (reduced prices for students and senior citizens). However, there is no fee reduction for frequent use at present.\",\"The restrictions to access are also associated with lack of data sharing protocols, or data sharing restrictions embedded in local and international legal instruments. With different return periods by hazard types of different intensities, there is a strong need of continuous data collection, for which most cities and countries are not prepared. Monitoring target 11.5 requires not only efficient data collection systems, but also the existence of a governance framework including institutional arrangements with enough human and financial capacity and resource. Coordination between different actors and ministries has also been identified as a hindrance to disaster monitoring and management in many countries.\",\"In 2014, Gangwon-do and Jeju-do's GDP per capita were lower than the national average as well as the average OECD rural region. Four out of five predominantly rural regions had faster GDP per capita growth than the national average in 2000-2014 (Figure 1.9). The highest growth rate occurred in Chungcheongnam-do, where the GDP per capita grew by 6.2%.\",\"In some regions, rates above established norms or for buildings without metering system are higher. According to official data, sanitation is the only municipal utility subsector since 2000 where the increase in user tariffs has matched inflation (Figure 1.23). It is worth noting that nationwide tariffs on central district heating have been falling in real terms for almost 15 years. This partly reflects authorities’ concern with the social impact of insufficient heating in Kazakhstan’s harsh climate. According to the OECD (2014b), rates for district heating in Kazakhstan are lower than in Central and Eastern European countries (Table 1.6). This is largely explained by low fuel price (mainly low coal prices), but also by insufficient or inexistent coverage of capital expenditures in heating tariffs, as noted above.\",\"Some OECD governments go further, seeking to direct growth to particular regions (e.g. outside a capital city) or to particular areas within a city (e.g. inner-city development). Korea, for instance, has attempted to address regional disparities by directing growth to less-developed regions and alleviating agglomeration pressures on major population and industrial centres. While most often implemented by lower levels of government, these tools often require legitimation through national legislation, and may be motivated by national strategies for sustainable urban development. They can include the public acquisition of land, regulation (e.g. zoning provisions, development moratoria, urban growth boundaries, green belts) and fiscal policies (e.g. development impact fees, infill or redevelopment incentives).\",\"A more systematic use of wastewater treatment, public transport and water supply tariffs and charges could help to raise more revenue while increasing the sustainability of green utility systems. Parking taxes and charges offer one such instance. The City of Bandung is considering increasing parking fees to discourage car use. This could be combined with West Java Province’s current policy of reserving some parking slots for energy-efficient cars identified with a blue sticker.\",\"The parties would also regularly hold discussion forums and workshops to bring together staff and researchers from the two organisations. Information on best practices, innovations, technologies and approaches would be shared at these events, as would ideas for new initiatives and ongoing collaboration. Finally, the parties would seek ways to better engage UBC students in specific projects identified by Metro Vancouver. In past years, collaboration on these issues lias been largely reactive and inconsistent.\",\"This may end up marginalising subnational entities in greater financial distress, as they cannot afford to pay the remaining share of the matching funds (Kim et al., Standardised, earmarked and conditional grants in Korea often end up restricting the flexibility of local authorities, thus reducing their ability to meet local demands and risking sub-optimal spending (Jones and Yokoyama, 2005). Interestingly, this concern seems to fade when comparing the per-capita amount of subsidies from MOLIT and the financial independency rate of local governments, which shows a strong negative correlation: the higher the financial independency rate of the metropolitan city or the province, the less subsidies the latter received from MOLIT (Figure 1.23).\",\"All inhabitants of the 19 districts of Dakar are eligible (under certain administrative conditions). Loans extend from CFA 200 000 to CFA 2.5 million for individual entrepreneurs and from CFA 200 000 to CFA 5 million for economic interest groups. Loans range from 6 to 24 months with a 6% annual interest rate (i.e. 0.5% per month).\",\"This suggests the need for a detailed assessment of progress and for improved data systems if no one is to be left behind.7 Against this background, some cities appear as sites of opportunity, but others of growing risk. Occupying the same geographical space does not imply equal access to opportunity or equal rights, even in democracies. Political controversies are becoming increasingly strident in many regions as countries face multi-national societies with the strong probability of increased immigration in the future.\",\"For the latter, the figure shows the percentage of a particular purpose travel of all travels occurring per every hour of the day. At the same time, however, the ticket fare should not exceed the level at which the passengers would consider the ticket fare to be affordable. Too high prices can cause the demand for mobility shifting from public transport to other modes.\",\"For example, the outcome document of the 10th Anniversary of the World Summit on Sustainable Development provided different anchor points for a mobility policy from which environment and health could benefit. Sustainable transport is a key ingredient for the achievement of most SDGs, particularly those related to education, food security, health, energy, infrastructure, and environment. Sustainable transport has to do with safety, affordability, accessibility, resilience, climate resilience and efficiency (including resource efficiency and the AVOID, SHIFT IMPROVE approach for increased environmental sustainability).\",\"One of the initiatives of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 is the development of sustainable urbanisation strategies in ASEAN cities. This includes the launching of a smart transportation initiative for public transportation and non-motorised transportation. These include employment creation, social and environmental impacts, and alignment with broader development strategies and resource mobilisation (OECD, 2018a). Public and private funds have roles to play in financing sustainable investments in public transportation. Public financing could benefit from the development of new sources of revenue, including land value capture tools that allow governments to collect revenue generated through the effects of improved infrastructure and services on nearby land values (OECD, 2015a).\",\"Just as in the case of concessioned buses, no fare adjustments are conducted regularly, and when increases happen, these are quite significant and are not expected by the population. This has increased political pressure to keep tariffs low, as social protest arises each time a substantial increment is implemented. A December 2013 survey of underground users showed that 56% of respondents agreed with a fare increase from MXN 3 to MXN 5 if the government could guarantee a decrease in crowding, waiting times, delays in service, as well as improvement of trip conditions, such as air conditioning and improved safety (Mitofsky, 2013).52 This fare increase was implemented in 2014. However, public faith in its ability to realise the promised improvement has been dented by major events, such as the need to stop operations of the newly constructed Line 12 (due to the acquisition of unsuitable trains) and the collision of two trains in May 2015 (El Economista, 2015). In the case of the underground, the gap between real and actual fares meant a loss of almost MXN 12 000 million in revenues in 2012.\",\"Access to international markets also means that the international carriage of goods proceeds in safe, secure and pollution preventive conditions that are acceptable to all signatory countries, this is the main objective of certain multilateral agreements such as the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (see also section 5.4), the Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to be Used for such Carriage (see box \\\"Transport of Perishable Foodstuffs\\\" below). In addition, these Agreements contain harmonized requirements accepted by all Contracting Parties and provisions for mutual recognition of certificates, which contribute extensively, to the facilitation of the international transport of such sensitive goods. The Centre is developing a set of e-Business standards including UN\\u002fCEFACT XML Message specifications56 and the UN\\u002fCEFACT Core Component Library57 which contains information on data and structures used in e.g. the Data Model of the World Customs Organization (UNECE, 2012).\",\"All these elements have caused chronic shortages of land, especially for the urban poor57 reducing the efficiency of the city. Several countries and cities are adopting and adapting this technique in order to accommodate a variety of legal frameworks and public-private relationships.63 Many others are improving the legal tools to assist with this process. In many cities, even long-established public spaces such as parks and open areas are under threat from development. The most common public space, street surface areas are being reduced in newly urbanized areas of both developed and developing countries.68 It is not only that the share of the public space is cut down, but also the very notion of the public realm.\",\"Finally, given the current saturation of public transportation in cities like Santiago, such a fee reduction policy should be introduced with measures to increase the system’s capacity and improve inter-modal co-ordination. This is less costly than single-ticket prices in Madrid (between EUR 2 and EUR 1.50) or Paris (EUR 1.90). However, a traveller buying a set of 10 tickets in these two European capitals can lower the cost per trip to a price almost equal to that of Santiago’s during peak hours (close to EUR 1.20 both in Madrid and Paris).\",\"In each of these locations, the Pathways programme is delivered by a local non-profit agency with credibility and a history of working with the community1. Pathways to Education website, https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.pathwavstoeducation.ca. The benefits of investing in early childhood education and care are seen in the performance of 15-year-olds in the PISA (OECD, 2014c).\",\"In selecting the best location they weigh their preferences for access to land, labour (skilled or unskilled), inputs from other firms, market access (including the transport links to other cities or countries) and access to knowledge and amenities. A flexible land market allows households and firms to respond as economic conditions change, fostering innovation and competitiveness. Even the idea that a free urban real estate market can exist outside of government intervention is erroneous because governments help to determine where to locate infrastructure, public services and open spaces.\",\"To monitor the progress, the MOLIT will provide quarterly reviews on the performance indicators set by each regions, and then the results will be reflected in the next year’s implementation plan. For example, the concept of Happy Living Zones has been derived from the need for regional perspectives to support self-sustaining development of rural areas. Although Korea’s public finances are fiscally sound, it is a priority to pursue fiscal efficiency to prepare projected long-term fiscal challenges (OECD, 2018[i2j).\",\"In respect of MDG Target 7.D: By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers, Belarus’s indicator has increased from 22.9 m~ of residential floor area per capita in 2005 to 26.1 m2 in 2014. The new energy efficient housing output in 2009 and 2010 followed the planned volumes of the Integrated programme for design, construction and reconstruction of energy efficient residential buildings in the Republic of Belarus for 2009-2010 and until 2020. However, in 2011, it was 20 per cent less than the planned 600,000 m2. These norms depend on the type of residential building and structural solutions used (i.e. heat recovery ventilation).\",\"The potential transborder nature of the issue may also require co-operation at the regional level, as is being done in Emerging Asia (Box 3.2). This frequently happens with emissions from energy production and heavy industry or from the burning of forests for agriculture. Regional solutions are therefore required.\",\"Data of India relate fiscal years. Investments in quality transport infrastructure result in benefits to the communities directly affected. They can directly generate employment opportunities related to construction, operations and maintenance, indirectly improve opportunities for individuals and firms, improve the efficiency of existing forms of economic activity, and generate various social and environmental benefits. Affected communities also benefit from spillovers such as lower input costs, increased choice in input supplies, expanded local trade and access to new markets for output (White and Raitzer, 2017).\",\"There is often not enough space to accommodate people who live in high-risk zones within the boundaries of one local government unit. Permanent resettlement to another local government unit is very difficult to accomplish given the lack of funds, and limited co-ordination within and between municipalities and cities that would be necessary to provide land and livelihoods for informal settlers. The build back better mentality promoted by risk management initiatives (that aims to restore the infrastructure and livelihoods in the same at-risk areas), often compounds the problem, given the lack of resources and co-operation necessary to adequately protect people and infrastructure with adequate long-term mitigation and prevention measures.\",\"However, contracts can be innovative policy tools that can provide flexibility among levels of government to respond to challenges without compromising stability (OECD, 2018[u]). Both France and Italy make use of contracts and the case of Sweden places a bigger emphasis on the promotion of wellbeing in rural areas. In addition, it has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the competences of the representative of the central government at the subnational level -namely the prefect.\",\"A strong mismatch in Russia between needed investments in road infrastructure and growing car ownership results in congestion, overused roads in poor conditions and deteriorating public transport systems. The share of car trips in Russia (68%) is still lower than in such OECD countries as France (84%), Sweden (83%) and Belgium (75%), and it is likely to increase further, to similar levels (Donchenko, 2013). Investments in transport, particularly urban public transport infrastructure, are insufficient to accommodate growing urban mobility needs and to compensate for chronic under-investment during the late Soviet period. Sub-national investment capacity for urban transport infrastructure is low and federal investment programmes are too sparse to have a sustainable impact on municipal transport systems (Box 3.10).\",\"Notably in five carefully-defined areas, residential growth will be promoted at the same time as existing public transport routes are made more efficient, and new rail links are created where needed. Major stations and bus terminals will also be developed as areas for shopping and for socialisation. Building an inclusive city: Cape Town’s TOD strategic framework {cont.)\",\"The growth rate of the elderly dependency ratio has been the largest in rural regions when compared to other type of regions. However, this pattern varies across rural regions. The elderly dependency ratio ranges from 7 percentage points (Chungcheongnam-do) to 15 percentage points (Jeollanam-do). With 35%, Jeollanam-do had the highest elderly dependency ratio in 2017.\",\"Resistance among people living in risk zones to moving to secure places is another example. Citizens are aware of environmental problems, but not of their role both in creating the problem and resolving it. The strategies for development and climate change in both Mexico City and the State of Mexico promote the need for public consultation in forums and seminars, but there is little evidence of a strategy to actively engage the public in policy decisions, and the voluntary sector’s involvement in climate change actions is limited.\",\"Often computed at national level, road mortality can be misleading when computed at city level, as activity levels in some cities cannot be measured by resident population alone. In urban cores, where many jobs and services are concentrated, the daytime population can be much higher than the resident population. This figure is important to better capture the activity level within an area and was provided by 19 cities. In FUAs, the assumption is that resident and daytime population are not significantly different, since the FUA definition is based on commuter flows.\",\"As a result, it is not surprising that some shared vehicle drivers, for instance, report that the biggest obstacle to driving an EV in the network is a lack of rapid charging stations in areas of high mobility demand (e.g. downtown centres or airport queues). The need for time-consuming charging, often multiple times per day, for example, reduces drivers' availability for offering rides and earning fares. Drivers report that range anxiety can lead them to decide to cancel trips.\",\"Such principles have recently adopted in 2015 by UN-Habitat Governing Council. However, there is not sufficient detail on how these towns will be developed to provide functional complementarity and accessibility to infrastructure, services, jobs and other advantages that can be found in Minsk. Also, the social, economic and environmental sustainability effects of this policy have not been well articulated.\",\"As always, the major challenge is to combine individual goals (people want to live in single family homes, and businesses prefer to choose where they will operate) with the broader public interest of managing development so that society collectively is better off. Infill mechanisms, such as BIMBY (build in my backyard) appear attractive, but are not common in the area, and are not so easy to manage. Such building projects easily lead to neighbourhood conflicts and legal challenges.\",\"Under this Forum, the Bangkok 2020 Declaration was developed, which includes “Sustainable Transport Goals for 2010-2020” in order to demonstrate a regional commitment to measures for achieving safe, secure, quick, reliable, affordable, efficient, people-centric and environmentally friendly transport in rapidly urbanising Asia.

It houses a range of renowned universities and research institutes, and it attracts around 40% of the immigrants who arrive in the country every year. The Toronto region also has an enviable reputation for quality of life, and has positioned itself as Canada’s main economic centre, thanks to demographic and economic growth since the 1970s-1980s.\",\"A new' feature will be added in order to enable all transaction prices to be recorded in the cadastral database. A link is also being built between the cadastral database and the taxation database in order to develop a more comprehensive and fairer taxation system, with an expected improvement of property tax revenues. The power to regulate the use of land usually lies in the smallest unit of government (e.g. municipalities through building and zoning codes) and local governments carry the legal responsibility for preparing urban land-use plans. In contrast, transport planning tends to controlled by higher levels of government (e.g. state governments and MPOs in the United States).\",\"This mode is being implemented to reduce congestion and promote healthier living by some cities that are experiencing congested sidewalks and broken bicycles that contribute to unsightly littering. With government support, both are also operating in Singapore. The fastest adopters of this mode of transport are young users. Mobike has 6,000 bicycles and records 20,000 rides a day.\",\"The central government accounted for 57% of government expenditures and 89% of government revenues (OECD, 2016a). The Ministry of Finance is transferring part of the national budget to all local governments. The General Allocation Fund (DAU) and the Special Allocation Fund (DAK) accounted for 51% and 5%, respectively, of regency and city revenues in 2015 (OECD, 2016a), transfers also dramatically increased, from USD 9.1 billion in 2001 to USD 43.7 billion in 2011 (Ritonga et al.,\",\"This model of having both the private sector and civil society at the Board level of a regional organisation can be seen as a means to institutionalise innovation, accountability and transparency. This is also a strategy to build a constituency on the ground and give more visibility to such metropolitan forms of action. It is a consortium of the 13 LGUs composing Metro Cebu (7 cities -Cebu, Danao, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, Naga, and Carcar and 6 municipalities Compostella, Liloan, Consolacion, Cordova, Minglanilla, and San Fernando), regional line agencies of the national government, private sector representatives and civil society organisations. This model of having both the private sector and civil society at the Board level of a regional organisation can be seen as a means to institutionalise innovation, accountability' and transparency.\",\"Many prosperous cities have developed or transformed their transport systems from traditional to sustainable and smart systems. Sustainable transport systems offer social, economic and environmental returns that support the goals of Agenda 2030. Given that the transport system is a space where people spend significant amounts of time every day, governments and city decision makers need to consider comfort and safety issues as well as conditions of dignity for users.\",\"A survey of 1 000 young migrants of 14 to 29 conducted in Almaty City in 2012 showed that 54.2% of the respondents had no registration in the city, while 50.9% were still registered at their previous place of residence (Makhmutova, 2012). This problem also exists in Astana: of 124 internal migrants who had settled there permanently, 24% did not have registration there in 2014 (Tukmadieva, 2015). It is not possible to enrol children in kindergarten or public schools without local registration.\",\"In addition, the current expansion of the metropolitan area towards its outskirts (the fastest growing LGUs are Carcar and Danao City) create increasing demand for public transport system in these areas. Similarly, road widths are not being maintained across LGU boundaries, which precludes good, co-ordinated transportation (and land use) planning. The same types of problems can be observed in other sectors, such as water supply and sanitation (see Chapter 3).\",\"This could be done via grants from international financing institutions to fund, for example, municipal housing stock owned by local authorities. Energy-efficiency requirements should be set for these private developers, as well as other requirements. This can include communal and private housing stock, as well as low-rise buildings with few apartments.\",\"Recent debates on changes in Dutch land-use policy have led some academics to conclude that active land policy has reached its limits (Boelens, 2010, Buitelaar, 2010, Munoz-Gielen, 2010, van der Krabben, 2011). One reason is financial: it requires long-term, front-end investment by government bodies (mainly municipalities) on the expectation that they will be able to recoup the costs by selling building plots. But the downturn of the property market since 2008 has resulted in building plots being sold much more slowly and for less than forecast. In some cases, this has resulted in municipalities suffering huge losses that will never be recovered.\",\"Stakeholder involvement is important not only in building support for new initiatives but also for finding solutions to technical and other challenges in implementation. Stakeholder inclusiveness can also help achieve a shared understanding of objectives that lead to more effective involvement and co-operation. With the proper framework and partnership among planners, authorities, operators and customers, this could be a self-supporting process. Many cities have little experience with the latest technologies in public transport services.\",\"The development of our cities will thus determine the future economic, social and territorial development of the European Union. Cities are also the places with sufficient concentration and critical mass to have the potential to put Europe on a more sustainable development trajectory. The highest unemployment rates are found in cities.\",\"Individuals may have no access to infrastructure or may “buy\\\" illegal hook-ups. The ability of developers and individuals to find out about available land is hampered by incomplete records. In many countries the costs - in time, money and number of offices visited -to formally construct and register a building are substantial.\",\"All levels of government could use the JICA-MCDCB roadmap and the present study as a basis to design projects collectively. It could be an opportunity to attract more easily official development finance at the local level but also to give the LGUs - and in particular the MCDA if created - a more important role in attracting international finance to realise urban green growth objectives. Such local mechanism has already been set up in several main cities in Viet Nam, with support of the French Development Agency (AFD). Such initiative could be supported by the national government, and in particular the Philippines Development Bank and the Land Bank of the Philippines.\",\"Current production of desalinated water is expected to quadruple by 2019 (Edwards et al., While large-scale desalination significantly increases water availability, it has potentially adverse environmental impacts in the form of greater energy consumption and subsequent increases in greenhouse gas emissions (OECD, 2011 a). Brine discharges to the sea can lead to substantial increases in salinity and temperature, and to the accumulation of metals (e.g. iron), hydrocarbons and toxic anti-fouling compounds in receiving waters (Roberts et al.,\",\"Contracts — that can be broadly defined as an arrangement that reorganises the rights and duties of governments — define mutual obligations and agree on authority and enforcement mechanisms (formal or informal), can be innovative policy tools to enable flexible collaboration among levels of governments. In this context, the experiences of France, Italy and Sweden are useful examples for Korea. This paper looks into the experienced of these countries to derive some policy lessons that could be important in the Korea context. One of the main puiposes of the decentralisation in France was to reform the system of central planning. Contracts have been developed since 1980s in the French decentralisation efforts aiming at reforming the system of central planning. As an “empowerment contract”, the CPER is a tool for transferring responsibilities to subnational governments while gradually building capacities for policy implementation.\",\"For example, overall effects of urban planning and design on levels of physical activity and a range of related health outcomes are now well evidenced, especially in developed countries (Smit et al. Such policies may be especially important in low- and medium-income countries where rapid urbanisation and related developments have resulted in the loss of outdoor spaces conducive to sport and active recreation (Akindes and Kirwan 2009). However, spaces that allow both structured and unstructured engagement in sport and active recreation, alongside other leisure pursuits, can encourage wider family and community engagement, and more sustained use (McCormack et al.\",\"They are more likely to make sense where they help address other issues, including risk sharing, technical expertise, and project design and management. A recent OECD survey found that the lack of adequate capacity for sub-national governments to manage PPPs was seen as a significant challenge by 16 of 19 responding OECD country governments (OECD, 2013c). Governments wishing to expand the role of private finance in urban public investment may therefore need to address these capacity issues before proceeding very far - for example, by establishing dedicated PPP units that can work with local authorities (OECD, 2010d).\",\"Indeed, urban populations are expected to soon exceed rural populations (figure 4.1). Ninety per cent of the world's urban expansion is in developing countries. As of 2017,23 of the world's 37 megacities are in Asia, of which eight of the top 10 megacities are in Asia, including the top three. However, nearly half of urban dwellers live in emerging cities with populations of less than half a million.\",\"The self-reporting system and periodical expert inspections should be operated more stringently, by for example increasing penalties for non-compliance. In addition, financial support for SMEs to improve their emission treatment system should be considered a top priority. Energy-efficient production systems can cut the cost per unit of production and increase price competitiveness, in addition to consuming less energy. Energy efficiency in industry in the city can also reduce electricity consumption at the national level.\",\"Vertical co-operation and co-ordination is all the more important in this perspective. The national government should take an active role in the creation and management of the MCDA and work with all relevant LGUs even before the application process to ensure full success of the application. Local governments need funding tools, capacity building in terms of effective public investment, and planning professionals need a working knowledge of how to prioritise and implement the plans they develop. In addition, the reliance of LGUs on national grants through the IRA, as well as the weakness of the proposed MCDA legislation regarding financing, indicates a real need for a more robust funding strategy and understanding of how to successfully achieve integrated public investment across levels of government. In this context, creating a more effective public investment framework is crucial (Box 4.4). For example, central government’s earmarked transfers could be better aligned with CLUPS for the entire Metro Cebu, so that national funds contribute coherently to local strategies.\",\"In addition, significant discounts for public transport fares and transfers were granted to Easy Card users (Najman, 2008). In Taipei, use of private vehicles has been significantly reduced by improvements in public transport infrastructure and services. Demand management has also played a key role. For example, since 1999, motorcycles have no longer been permitted to park along sidewalks, and motorcycle parking pricing was introduced in certain areas in 2004.\",\"It region ranks among the top 12% among all OECD regions in the indicator for civic engagement which is measured by voter turnout (84.2%).

There are new concerns about the impact of run-off from farming on w'ater quality (e.g. manure and pesticide and fertiliser impacts). Similarly, the threat of contamination from spills by mining operations remains a concern. For example, there is competition over agricultural lands between different categories of users.\",\"Cities and countries reporting on this indicator are encouraged to promote better design and use of streets as public spaces. The fact that the indicator measures the share of the built-up area allocated to open space makes it sensitive to the definition of what constitutes a city and its built-up area.

Definitions on what constitutes public space, public use and the notion of open were agreed upon by experts through consultative meetings.35 Disaggregation of information by sex, age and persons with disabilities remains a key challenge which requires conducting comprehensive surveys in cities on public spaces.\",\"The work also investigates alternative implementation strategies, namely replacing vs. preserving existing bus rapid transit (BRT) networks. In Auckland, simulations indicate that preserving BRT corridors is always more advantageous than replacing them. In areas characterised by low frequency bus services, however, existing performance appears to be worse than that which could be achieved by shared mobility services.\",\"After investment approval has been attained, and the environmental impact favourably appraised, the proponent must submit a request for land allocation to the local Department of Natural Resources and Environment. A construction permit based on detailed design of the project is also required. Under the relevant Construction Law, construct permits are issued either by the Ministiy of Construction, the provincial Department of Construction, or the District-Level People's Committee, depending on the complexity of the project. After approval, the project proponent negotiates the compensation and resettlement plan.\",\"The activities of these social enterprises cover a wide range of services, for example, a social enterprise for the elderly’s health care offers medical services through medical cooperatives in areas of higher proportion of the elder residents. Not only providing medical services for the elderly, the enterprise functions as a vehicle for collaboration between various local actors including local government, volunteer organisation and private companies. Partly funded by the Provincial support fund and subsidies from municipalities, the social enterprises are operating with their own incomes from membership fees and medical service provision. Though the balanced development is not new in the Korean policy agenda, the focus has diversified from solely economic and industrial development, which in fact enhanced the national income and living conditions across the country while widened the regional disparity, to include securing quality of life nationwide.\",\"Open and expansive data will also serve to estimate population changes and density variations at intracity levels. These registries inform land consumption rates relevant to this indicator. For example, the e-Government Domain, within the Regulatory Programme Development Area at UN\\u002fCEFACT, is developing two white papers aimed at reviewing both the technical applications of Blockchain to UN\\u002fCEFACT deliverables on data exchange, and another on use-cases in a wide variety of areas of application in which this technology could provide opportunities for efficient, effective and trusted systems. Several countries, such as The Netherlands, India, Kenya and Switzerland have already begun piloting blockchain-based land registry systems, which are expected to have a significant impact on promoting inclusive and integrated urbanization through the principles of immutability of records and system decentralization. Participatory, transparent, accountable urban planning and management, and the creation of an enabling environment, are important steps in assessing how national and local governments involve people, communities and organizations in implementing, monitoring, and evaluating SDGs policies and programmes such as urban planning.\",\"Currently, bike-share systems are dominated by dock-based networks where bicycles are picked up and returned at specific stations. An alternative, emerging model for bike-share is centred on dockless fleets of bicycles that can be picked up and dropped off anywhere within a within a geo-fenced zone. In these instances, bicycles come equipped with on-board GPS and communications equipment.\",\"Since the early 2000s, the Netherlands has gradually shifted its approach to environmental policy formulation. Moving from “command-and-control” style planning, the government is now playing a more hands-off role using incentives and innovation to change business and consumer behaviour. Further, it recognises that the transition towards a circular economy is complicated and novel, requiring a certain amount of trial and error to reach a robust policy. Moreover, the identification of realistic objectives, development of indicators and measurement of progress for resource efficiency is complex. The choice of indicators to measure progress is still the subject of debate. While policy makers generally agree on the need to reuse resources and produce more with less, agreement on the extent of the desired change is more elusive.\",\"The project is expected to cost USD 228.5 million (World Bank, 2014). The objective of the BRT project is to improve the performance of the urban transport system in the areas of quality of service, safety and environmental efficiency. The BRT will run between Barangay Talamban in the north and Barangay Bulacao in the south.\",\"Moreover, the leadership of regional and urban development policy has been unstable. In 2013, the creation of the Ministry of Regional Development (MRD) was announced. This had all the levers for developing and implementing comprehensive urban and regional development policies, except for the allocation of revenue authority and budgetary transfers to SNGs.\",\"In 2015, Sudan was removed from the “black list” of the Financial Action Task Force, an international financial-fraud monitoring body located at the OECD. However, the continued difficulties of processing international banking transactions may fuel informal transfers, contribute to exchange-rate distortion, and reduce fiscal revenues. In urban areas, job creation is above average and the poverty rate is less than half of the national average.\",\"The GORE Planning Divisions might play a key role to this effect and could be supported by their investment units, established to evaluate if projects support the realisation of ERD initiatives. There are indications that regional portfolios increasingly integrate projects that involve two or more municipalities in the region.14 However, as long as municipalities have insufficient resources to finance the execution of their main devolved competences, a need to use regional development resources for financing basic local investment and maintenance requirements can persist, making it more difficult to finance the overall development priorities defined in the regional strategies. The plan includes a diagnostic stage of the cities’ main challenges, and a subsequent proposal for a portfolio of projects to be implemented with a long-term perspective. This tool was created after the 2010 earthquake to improve the co-ordination and effectiveness of urban reconstruction efforts.\",\"Basic services and infrastructure development, including transport and mobility, must be people-centred, with dearly-defined links to land-use plans and housing programmes, with the main focus on vulnerable and marginalized groups.77 Prioritizing basic service and infrastructure delivery must feature in any long-term economic and social development and environmental protection strategy. Governments must pay more attention to how, when, and with which standards70 they measure issues such as accessible and sustainable transport, adequate and affordable housing, inclusive urbanization, universal access to safe public spaces, and many other important urban targets that are strongly connected to the New Urban Agenda. The CPI provides both a metric and a framework for policy dialogue, giving cities and governments the possibility to devise indicators and baseline information, often for the first time.\",\"However, when the concentration in cities has reached a certain level, negative externalities such as pollution, cost of land, cost of labour and travel time, among others, tend to increase and affect their competitiveness. The urbanisation process then continues to spillover to nearby places where the cost of land is more accessible, replicating the process of saturation again. The state of Morelos has put environmental sustainability at the heart of decision making.\",\"Clusters such as Otigba computer village in Lagos emerge and grow organically, and show immense resilience, but their expansion or transformation is often limited by a host of challenges beyond their collective effort. They would benefit from policy support. Big data can inform transport planning and how investments are prioritized.\",\"Fuel excise taxes are applied in all Emerging Asian countries except in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia and Viet Nam. Subsidies in the region reduce fuel prices, encouraging greater use of motor vehicles. These subsidies, while considerable in several Emerging Asian countries, have been reduced or eliminated in recent reforms, though rising global oil price is still a challenge.\",\"Despite the potential for increased fuel efficiency, ICE vehicles alone do not represent a viable long-term solution for decarbonising the urban passenger transport sector for two reasons. First, a significant gap remains between fuel efficiency standards and the real-world operational fuel efficiency of ICE vehicles, which ultimately limits the effectiveness of these types of standards as a measure for reducing emissions. Although fuel efficiency standards have become 30% more stringent between 2000 and 2016, actual fuel efficiency as measured by real world performance, has only improved by 11% over the same period.\",\"The opinions expressed and arguments employed herein do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Organisation or of the governments of its member countries. It assesses urban sectors and activities that foster growth and reduce pressure on the environment, focusing on land use and transport, including eco-districts, energy efficiency in buildings, waste recycling, district heating and renewable energy. Public transport should link the proposed nodes more effectively, particularly those planned in the City of Stockholm with those planned elsewhere in the County. It is also important that existing urban areas in each node are densified, to prevent urban sprawl around the nodes.\",\"Although industrialized nations clearly have a critical role to play in mitigating greenhouse gases and while adaptation should be the key priority for Southern African cities, expanding urban centres such as Gaborone, Harare and Maputo are generating increasing carbon emissions through their various energy intensive activities and they too need to accept a role in mitigation. Some local governments are beginning to recognize this. These are due to historically entrenched inequalities in terms of responsibilities for emissions, as well as income disparities.\\\" Poor urban households in RSA can spend up to 75 per cent of their budgets on food and energy alone.\",\"Many OECD cities have a 10-ticket “bonus” or monthly or yearly passes with lower per-use fares than individual tickets (see Box 2.16). Such a mechanism could further attract passengers and provide a less costly public transport solution for lower-income riders. To ensure a positive social outcome, such measures in Chile would need to be tailored to low-income residents’ lack of capacity to save. A progressive reduction of the price relative to monthly frequency of use would be one option (e.g. a weekly, bi-monthly or monthly pass that maximises per-trip savings).\",\"The governing board (Mega Cebu Development Board, not to be confounded with MCDCB) will also be composed, among others, of the Mayors of the 13 LGUs of Metro Cebu and Directors of Region VII National Government Agencies in relevant sectors mentioned above (Republic of the Philippines, 2015). A similar approach was undertaken in British Columbia, where the legislation guiding the role and authority of regional districts around regional planning clearly speaks to a collaborative relationship, but authority over land use planning at the local level. The ‘soft’ relationship is both successful in terms of partnership and collaboration and shared vision, but challenged by an inability to require the vision to be implemented.\",\"The indicator is designed to measure whether residents are able to participate in the urban planning and management of their cities. Given the complex and subjective nature of participation, the indicator focuses on formal structures that are available for civil society. However, several steps have been taken to refine the methodology to internationally acceptable standards.\",\"These subsidies, however, have not always lead to the intended results because of difficulties with accurately identifying the target population, potential abuse of the subsidy, and large errors of either exclusion or inclusion of the target population. Therefore, as cities grow and their roadways cannot be expanded anymore, the volume of urban traffic needs to be managed within the given roadway capacity. Any surpassing of that capacity leads to traffic congestion - the most apparent transport externality. Furthermore, the extra fuel burned causes unnecessary release of carbon dioxide, hence adding to the overall bill issued by congestion that societies have to pay in the end.\",\"The most optimal approach to ensure this was to model a Shared Taxi fleet that was 100% accessible - as is the case in certain cities around the world.

It supports PPP projects by developing documentation (the concession proposal, tender documentation, the draft concession agreement), negotiating with potential investors and concessionaries. These recommendations are based on the experience of the oblast and city of Pavlodar, but they may be equally valuable for other cities, as they present similar problems in the public utilities sector.\",\"Finally, a local counterpart made of a neighbourhood development council manages the programme. The phases vary in length according to the complexity and needs of the neighbourhoods. During Phase One, trust is established between the neighbours and the team in charge of the project, and their collaborative work begins. The first activity is a technical study with a diagnosis of the urban and social environment and the safety conditions in the neighbourhood. The study identifies the most important shortages and the key actors, and proposes an integrated plan of action. Simultaneously, the team helps the community diagnose its problems, promoting the involvement of all the social groups living in the neighbourhood and soliciting their demands and expectations.\",\"At the same time, national policies for employment and training policies are more effective when they draw on local knowledge to match skills development with job opportunities and are adapted to the local labour market conditions (OECD, 2014c). Local governments play an essential role in, among other things, enhancing and sustaining skill formation, job creation and supporting transitions throughout the life cycle by building comprehensive local career information and well-articulated training to employment pathways (OECD, 2016b). Moreover, city governments are well-positioned to support partnerships with educational institutions, businesses located in their jurisdictions, trade unions and civil society towards better integrated policies and training programmes.\",\"Attainment of sustainable cities in many ways relate to effective planning, development and enforcement of inclusive policies, strong economic actions and strategies, environmental protection plans, sustainable investments which accommodate the needs of all people regardless of their age, gender, social or economic status. Data, information and knowledge are essential in responding to fundamental questions. Some of these are: Which are the drivers and actors of city growth?\",\"For example, within the classification system, cities must achieve a score of 70 out of 100 in order to move up in the ranks. Each of the six elements in the criteria is weighted differently. The highest weight of points target urban infrastructure, GDP, and population (55, 15, and 10 points respectively).\",\"At the same time, however, transport networks need to be developed in ways which minimize unacceptable adverse impacts. To date the rapid urbanization of Asian cities has, for the most part, resulted in cities that are heavily congested, are poor in urban amenity, suffer high levels of air pollution, emit substantial amounts of C02, inefficiently use scarce land resources, and present unequal access to opportunities for their residents. In the case of road congestion, the degraded amenity particularly affects and decreases the use of other, lower polluting road users, namely public transport, cycling and walking.\",\"The cadastre has introduced performance standards to motivate staff to work more efficiently. Staff exceeding the average can receive a salary increase of up to 25%. A customer asked about his recent experience reported having to wait in line outside the cadastre for 4 hours in the summer heat—but considered that a huge improvement over a few years ago, when transferring property took several months.\",\"Travel for the poor has thus become slower and more difficult even as other economic and planning forces have caused many of them to be displaced from central informal settlements to more peripheral locations (Immers and Bijil 1993)10. Access to affordable transport is one of the most important factors in determining livelihoods for the urban poor. A survey by SPARC in central Bombay of pavement dwellers showed that 80% walked to work.\",\"Where multiple communes exist in close proximity but have different objectives, there is a need for a mechanism to resolve these overlapping, but incompatible objectives in land use and other topics. As copiously illustrated by the example of the Grand Clermont metropolis, different laws and rules promulgated by national and local authorities as well as rules and land use zonings issued from EU decisions (like ZNIEFF or green and blue corridors) structure these relationships and ensure a coherence between all these institutional constraints and the various levels of decision making. But at the same time, one has to cope with the issue of the multiple planning documents and the governance structures that support them.\",\"Such a regulatory scheme has been proven effective in some OECD cities (Box 3.4).

Develop collaboration among local governments, business communities as well as universities to create effective policies and programmes to develop a skilled labour market for RE.\",\"Consequently, cities should support the business services development, including finance and information technology, and their linkages to industry. This requires both targeted and integrated urban economic policies. Governments attempting to select a location for industrial development should, for this reason, consider natural location-based characteristics as well as the powerful forces of infrastructure and agglomeration.\",\"This reform would require co-ordination between the Ministry' of Interior Affairs and the Ministry for Information and Communication, and the adoption of new' legislation. Since internal moves are not recorded formally there, information from the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR) and GP Patient Registers are used as a proxy for estimates of the population of England and Wales. This data is considered to be a good proxy for internal migration, since w'hen they move, most patients will eventually register w'ith a new GP.\",\"These innovations serve new demands in cities for enhanced services and improved interaction, making it possible to increase real-time insights on traffic and transportation for public authorities. The harmonization of data, which can be supported by UN\\u002fCEFACTs work on standardization of information exchanges and data flows, interacting together with blockchain smart contracts to initiate action, could serve for example. Most of the funds go towards supporting several activities linked to reducing air pollution including agriculture, oil, waste, diesel, transport, household energy and local planning.\",\"Committee members represent non-governmental actors and government officials connected to each specific commodity. Moreover, in some cases these committees have taken on a more political than technical character. Regions within Morelos are identified by areas having a significant production of a particular crop or commodity.\",\"The study also focused on the importance of cultural heritage as a factor attracting people to stay in the region. According to the study, about 60% of the tourists visited Raros because ofthetown's cultural heritage. In addition, around 40% of guests attending conferences stayed in Raros due to the cultural heritage of the town.\",\"Includes respondents living in a dwelling owned by a third individual (not a household member, but possibly a relative of family member) and not paying rent. In the Soviet era, these networks were based on inflated demand forecasts, and in single-industry towns (monotowns) utility networks were reliant on financial support and technical expertise from the town’s dominant industrial facility (ADB, 2012a). During the transition period, little or no investment was made in maintenance and repair of municipal networks. However, this recently changed, and repair and maintenance of municipal utility networks is prominent in the State Programme of Infrastructure Development (Nurly Zhol).29 Through this programme, municipal utility companies can benefit from heavily subsidised loans for which they apply through their local administrations. There are often no alternative heating options for urban households, since there is no natural gas supply infrastructure (except in urban centres in southern Kazakhstan, including Almaty City).\",\"In travel time figures, markers refer to average travel time at a specific hour within the day while the vertical bars represent the ranges of travel time. Speed limits are set to be 40km\\u002fh on the road in Jakarta, 60km\\u002fh on the road in Malaysia, 60km\\u002fh on the road in Metro Manila, 50km\\u002fh on the road in Singapore and SOkm\\u002fh on the road in Bangkok. Traffic congestion data are based on either entire specified road wherever possible or a selected representative segment of specified road. Data are not necessarily comparable across the five areas shown above. In some of the region’s larger cities, a significant amount of time is wasted in traffic congestion (Table 2.2). There are also additional economic costs in the form of increased fuel and other transportation costs, and reduced productivity and efficiency (Box 2.2).\",\"There is a much stronger emphasis on public transport than before, including reduced funding for motorways, new metro extension and tunnels, and substantial increases in all toll charges. Toll charges will also be differentiated and spread more widely across the region, with higher costs for diesel vehicles and during rush hour. Several priorities have been identified, a new bridge over the River Gota Alv, which divides the city, a new tunnel under the same river, increasing the capacity in West Sweden to relieve the demand on Gothenburg Central Station, new investments in roads, a more sustainable public transport system, cycling lanes, etc.\",\"In September 2017, another project was launched, in partnership with a number of companies, for a lkm-long autonomous shuttle service in London. In November 2017, the first public, open road AV service (i.e. operational in traffic) was launched in Las Vegas, USA. In February 2018, another automated service was launched at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in France that uses V2X technology to co-ordinate two AVs crossing each other in open traffic.\",\"This is important but Metro Cebu needs to adopt a flexible approach to its implementation, ensuring equal distribution of spatial opportunities. As such it is important to align fiscal policies such as taxes with desired spatial development objectives (OECD, 2017). For example, the land use\\u002fzoning categorisation of Cebu City does not indicate any mixed land use. Arguably, it can be stated that some properties are not developed in their designated zones.\",\"Plans and policies designed in the BMA are influenced to large extent by policies and regulations issued by higher levels of government, in particular the national government. This affects not only general development objectives but also sectoral policies in opportunity areas for green growth (e.g. transport, energy). The main components of Indonesia’s National Development Plans (RPJPN 2005-2025 and RPJMN, 2015-2019) are translated at lower levels of government into the West Java Province Development Plans and into each of the five municipalities of BMA (e.g. Bandung Development Plans) (Table 4.1). This is a powerful instrument of policy harmonisation in Indonesia, and a means of boosting cities’ economic and environmental performance.\",\"This can help local authorities develop strategies for the ageing challenges specific to their community, in alignment with national development objectives. This will help attract national investment and create shared values among citizens, generating public support for the implementation of policies and raising a city’s profile. Calgary and Helsinki, for example, have set out long-term strategies with the overarching goal of a sustainable community that embraces citizens of all generations. In Calgary, imagineCALGARY is a 100-year vision and long-range urban sustainability plan that outlines Calgary’s goals and sets specific intermediate steps for becoming a sustainable community.\",\"Long-term projections of continuing growth in London’s economy and population (various scenarios are examined in the London Plan) are an essential input to the EDS. All proposals in the EDS must be consistent with the spatial strategy set out in the London Plan. The TfL is the statutory authority responsible for ensuring the deliveiy of the MTS. The MTS takes into account the emerging policies in the London Plan and the EDS and is supported by a detailed evidence base, including the “Travel in London” report, strategic transport models and recommendations from the Outer London Commission.\",\"The main functions are those provided directly by the metropolitan region or regional authority. For example, in Sao Paulo, transportation, planning and water and sanitation networks are provided by state companies for the metropolitan area.

Both tangible and non-tangible cultures can also be identified by location, religious and other beliefs, and by other characteristics such as common historical roots or experience. Resources are squandered, temperatures and sea levels are rising, and the numbers of people at risk of being left behind are staggering.\",\"Urban challenges can be separated into two broad categories: developed versus developing countries, and within those categories, primate versus secondary cities. This simplified typology is not intended to be exhaustive but rather illustrative of some of the differences in urban conditions and challenges which exist and would influence policy recommendations and specific solutions of the New Urban Agenda. The levels of GDP per capita of countries are used as proxies for level of development.\",\"It closes with a short conclusion. The combined uibanisation level of ASEAN-5 (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries increased from 29.5% in 1980 to 51.4% in 2015, and is expected to reach 67.7% in 2050. The aggregated urban population of these five countries increased from 79 million in 1980 to 271 million in 2015, and is forecasted to reach 452 million in 2050. Most of the population growth is happening in small and medium-sized cities.\",\"The targets are designed to be integrated and indivisible and to balance the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda further seeks to realize the human rights of all, and to achieve gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls. Unlike the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an ambitious agenda that is indivisible and supposed to be implemented universally by all countries in a collaborative partnership. The theme of each HLPF, and a subset of goals to be reviewed, is agreed in advance.\",\"Distances travelled vary considerably between cities as well, the length of the average trip by car is 14.2 km in Mumbai, but only 3.1 km in Bhopal. The pump price per litre of diesel varies across the region, from USD 0.22 in Brunei Darussalam to USD 0.81 in China and India, while that of gasoline ranges between USD 0.37 in Brunei Darussalam to USD 1.25 in Singapore (Figure 2.9). Fuel prices can account for a large share of drivers’ transportation costs (Box 2.4). These prices are affected by taxes, which are often designed to generate revenue and to price the environmental effects of vehicle emissions.\",\"However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime®*™ (WHO, 2013). There is also a high prevalence of psychological violence against women as 43 per cent of women in the European Union have experienced this form of violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime®*™ (AFR, 2014). As a result, significant progress has been made regarding the institutionalization of development and management of public spaces over the past decade.

A key lesson-learned indicates it is unlikely that m2aking more land available to accommodate the increasing population and the increasing traffic will solve the transport and spatial challenges. Sustainable solutions will require diversified policy instruments, particularly addressing land-use efficiency.\",\"The share of tradable goods and services explains more than half of the Gross Value Added of three (Chungcheongnam-do, Gyeonsangbuk-do and Jeollanam-do) out of five predominantly rural regions in 2016, in contrast to the remaining two rural regions (Jeju-do and Gangwon-do), which depend more on non-tradable sectors have recorded lower rates of GDP per capita growth over 2000-14,. However, challenges related to the quality of environment are not rural specific per se in Korea as it concerns the country as a whole. The level of air pollution is slightly lower in the selected TL2 region than at the national level.\",\"Given the potential impact of widespread AV use in urban areas, e.g. in terms of congestion, environment, road safety, user behaviour and infrastructure development, it will be important for cities to assume a more prominent role regarding AV policies. If this does not occur, the promised impacts of AV adoption may not materialise, or even generate negative impacts, e.g. if people shift from walking and cycling to personal AV use. It is therefore important to judiciously frame the introduction of AVs in order to ensure that this technology benefits, rather than hinders, mobility in urban areas. Accomplishing this represents a significant challenge: while AVs are an attractive choice for users, their attractiveness could in fact lead to over-purchasing, low utilisation capacities, congestion, urban sprawl, loss of public space, as well as the decreased use of public transit, walking, and cycling (along with the accompanying health implications).\",\"The General Ordinance develops the different regulations regarding administrative procedures, planning processes and relevant technical design standards for urbanisation and building. Technical norms define the technical characteristics related to projects and urbanisation, and construction materials and systems, in order to comply with the standards required by the Ordenanza General. The Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (Mimsterio de Viuienda y Urbanismo\\u002fMINVU), through its SEREMI (regional level offices) plays a supervisory role, ensuring that the regulations and norms of the General Law and the Ordinance are met.\",\"Those who carry out building confirmation and inspection in the private institutions are required to have the qualification equivalent to building officials. In 2014, approximately 4 500 people, including public building officials and private inspectors, were engaged. Private institutions accounted for 86% of building confirmations (in 2014) and 80% of final inspections (in 2013). The final inspection rate increased from the 40% in 1998 to about 90% in 2013. The new system also allowed public building officials to focus on conducting other important tasks such as auditing building officials and remedying non-conforming buildings.\",\"For example, one assumes that predicted traffic growth (particularly car travel) must be provided for (by adding road capacity). This approach has inevitably resulted in more travel, exacerbated car dependency1 and has encouraged dispersed patterns of development. The increased congestion comes at significant costs to the economy, the environment and the overall well-being of the population.\",\"Elsewhere in the region, these rates are 30 per cent for Kazakhstan and the Republic of Moldova and 19 per cent in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Romania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (UN-HABITAT 2005a). Although urban areas reportedly have higher levels of service, close to 3 million people in European cities lack access to piped water and 8 million to sewerage (UN-HABITAT 2005a). Data indicate that the situation regarding piped water supply in the housing stock in the EECCA4 countries is particularly problematic in Republic of Moldova and Uzbekistan, with services available in one third of the stock.\",\"Devising a stable funding stream is critical to ensuring a realistic planning process and encouraging co-ordinated decisions. An example is found in the United States, where metropolitan planning organisations (MPOs) were explicitly created for planning and programming federal transport funds (Box 2.2). The goal was to ensure that existing and future expenditures for transport projects and programmes were based on a “continuing, co-operative and comprehensive” (3-C) planning process. One of the most sophisticated examples of metropolitan transport co-ordination can be found in Germany. All large metropolitan areas in Germany have set up a metropolitan transport authority called Verkehrsverbund. Such transport authorities usually bring together all local governments located in the metropolitan area as w'ell as the corresponding Land (or Lander if there are several of them, as in the case of Hamburg).\",\"A multi criteria decision making technique, called “analytic hierarchy process” (AHP), is adopted to combine the quantitative and qualitative elements of the evaluation and give the final score. The mid-term and final PFS reports are discussed by the MOSF, line ministries, PIMAC and field specialists from the public and private sectors. If the project is found feasible, the line ministiy in charge conducts a more detailed feasibility study.\",\"Cities have started to work towards adopting appropriate regulatory frameworks to accompany the development of these services. The aim is to allow these services to deliver efficiency gains along with consumer and other benefits while mitigating their potential negative impact (Deighton-Smith, 2018). Considering such options can serve an accessibility agenda.\",\"The central bank is also looking to lower the reserve requirement ratio further in line with the reductions in March and June 2018. The capacity to meet the infrastructure plan while limiting associated fiscal risks remains a prominent near-term challenge. Concrete policies for continuing to develop regions outside Metro Manila, particularly in agriculture-dependent areas (Box 1.2), are crucial to spreading economic opportunities and managing population concentration and activities in the coming years.\",\"Without better co-ordination, it will be impossible to achieve a more coherent structure. In a study of metropolitan governance of Sydney, Australia that focuses on conflicts over land-use planning, Kubler explores the concepts of joint decision systems and negotiated agreements (Kubler, 2007: 637-639). These ideas are appropriate when actors engaged in a policy problem are unable to independently achieve their objectives and either unanimity or near unanimity is required for a successful solution. He discusses four ways to get to such a solution.\",\"It is, therefore, recommended that functional regulations and plans that favour land and housing affordability, energy consumption, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the overall increase in productivity values through economies of scale and agglomeration be adopted. To scale up the measurement of this indicator, there is a need to provide capacity-building to NSOs and to make accessible the appropriate technology. This should include local authorities that are responsible for the preparation of urban plans, regulatory mechanisms and land control, and the need they have to prepare evidence-based plans and policies. Several Expert Group Meetings (EGMs) have been held to promote the harmonization of the different elements of the methodologies and input data.\",\"Sustainable urbanisation” and corresponding activities in the VGGS and VGGAP could also be fine-tuned to reflect the increasing role of cities.

All the PGGAPs examined for this report have a focus on urban areas and include concrete projects that encompass issues from urban planning to capacity building or urban infrastructure investment (wastewater treatment, public transport, renewable energy such as rooftop solar panels, etc.).\",\"Feasibility studies for mass rapid transit have been conducted for Nairobi, Kampala and Dakar to pave the way for financing. In Kenya, six bus rapid transit corridors have been mapped out in Nairobi to reduce traffic congestion, travel time and cost. The corridors are expected to hold up to 950 high-capacity buses and reduce travel time and cost by up to 70 per cent (The East Africa, 2018). By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. Less compact cities have negative effects on development, since sprawl tends to reduce land-use efficiency - economically (e.g., proximity of factors of production), environmentally (e.g., lower per capita rates of resource use and GHG emissions), and socially (e.g., avoidance of settlement on vulnerable land and promotion of reduced travel times\\u002fdistances) (UN-Habitat, 2016, ECA 2017).\",\"First, if any of the involved bodies do not agree with the result, it is possible to request an opinion or decision of the Ministiy for Regional Development on the matter. Afterwards, there is also the possibility to appeal to the regular court. Further, the process is administratively onerous, requiring the binding opinions of 23 authorities for both steps.\",\"First, SNGs must have a strong base of own-source financing. Treating these regions and cities under a different transfer regime and granting them more power to set and collect taxes and fees would be essential. If local agencies have instruments for managing local budget revenues, local borrowing for capital investment would be expedient (Makhmutova, 2006). If infrastructure is to be maintained and debt obligations are to be met, regional and city governments need to be able to control their level of budgetary resources.\",\"It also seeks to help streamline smart sustainable cities' action plans and establish best practices with feasible targets that urban development stakeholders are encouraged to meet.

The key performance indicators are being implemented by 50 cities globally.\",\"These plans are the primary instrument for planning, managing and co-ordinating local development. They integrate a diagnosis of the socio-economic characteristics, strengths and challenges of the municipality and identify its main development priorities in such aspects as infrastructure, productive development, education and the environment (see Box 2.2). Given their comprehensive approach, PLADECO represent an interesting management tool to promote coherence between urban development, land-use planning and general economic development.\",\"The creation of such metropolitan transport authorities has facilitated fare integration and expansion of the public transport supply, as illustrated in the example of Frankfurt (Box 2.3). A few authorities also enjoy competencies in terms of public parking and sometimes urban spatial planning. Spatial planning encompasses a variety of activities across OECD countries.\",\"Chronic under-investment in utilities, infrastructure and networks, and unbalanced tariff structures are major problems. The main networks are owned federally, but the state does not contribute much to the maintenance or improvement of local infrastructures. At the same time, municipalities’ investments are declining and tariffs are rising. However, higher tariffs are not used to cover maintenance costs or to generate funds for investment in infrastructures and networks.\",\"The Pole metropolitain remains the dominant governance structure as the forum for large and small communes and the complex array of current intercommunal agreements, but it has neither the resources nor the authority to directly engage in spatial planning. Both are important in order to maintain territorial attractiveness, to attract new, younger people and to avoid an acceleration of population ageing. Achieving a better spatial balance in economic activity is also crucial.\",\"The rewards for this active engagement may vary from an improvement in the daily environment to actual shares in local projects and developments. Real property rights are defined in Book 5 of the Dutch Civil Code, in which ownership and land lease are defined. Ownership is the most comprehensive right that a person, the owner, can have to a thing.\",\"The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. The country’s real gross domestic product (GDP) has increased about sixteen-fold since 1970, while its share of urban population doubled in the period, from 40.7% in 1970 to 81.9% in 2009 (OECD, 2012e). Moreover, as most of Korea’s large metropolitan areas have developed in a piecemeal way in this brief period, the best use of limited land resources has become a major concern of urban policy makers.\",\"In addition, even in existing national legislation, the role dedicated to LGUs is often unclear and not well supported: despite the existence of the Clean Water Act (2004) and a national law for Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation, which are supposed to be mainstreamed into local plans, there is no effective implementation of the prescribed policies on the ground in Cebu, due to the lack of details on subnational responsibilities and resources. The creation of national policy frameworks would help to clarify responsibilities, especially for LGUs, while giving them appropriate resources. The Local Government Code of 1991 put LGUs in charge of the provision of basic services, including agriculture (power to reclassify agricultural land), health, social services, public works (enforcement of the National Building Code, power to close and open roads), and environment and natural resources.\",\"Alternative working arrangements can ease the problem and improve urban transportation systems. Large numbers of workers in cities strain both road capacity and the limits of public transportation systems. Flexible working arrangements (FWAs) are not widely used in many countries in the region, but could be used to either reduce demand or to shift demand from peak hours.\",\"The study led to a broader understanding of the project. Instead, it recommended that it include: the long-term multimodal functioning of the mobility network (the Ringway carries 35% of local traffic, and a relatively small shift to the local network or other modalities could solve the congestion at the national highway system near Utrecht), the investment climate of the eastern part of Utrecht including the campus, and the connectivity between Utrecht and the surrounding rural landscape. This favoured a shift from a defensive discussion about the highway project into an opportunity and quality-driven discussion, in which infrastructure was only one element. Spatial-economic development models for the university campus, together with the A27 Highway and redevelopment of the adjacent Rijnsweerd business park.\",\"The obligation to pay for municipally-managed wastewater treatment is also perceived as an unnecessary additional burden. For example, the EP fee for the households which are not connected to their sewerage system is only 10% of the water tariff, which provides no financial incentive for them to connect to the piped sewerage system. As a result, cities have tended to postpone the costly and unpopular sewerage construction process which also comes with street closure. Very little progress has been made towards universal connection of individual houses to sewerage systems (GGGI, 2016b).\",\"The budget is also overseen by the Krai Ministry of Economics and Regional Development, which is responsible for implementing regional policy measures that imply inter-regional co-operation. During the 1990s, it was opaque, largely ad hoc and focused on: i) supporting the poorest regions, and ii) responding to political pressure from stronger regions for fiscal privileges and greater autonomy. This changed in the early 2000s as bilateral agreements between the centre and the regions were scrapped and the system of fiscal federalism was reformed.\",\"Slums may be housing a gradually reduced portion of the urban population as local policies take effect and as incomes increase. However, for the hundreds of millions at the bottom of the urban system, garbage pickup and removal is almost non-existent, toilets, let alone public toilets, are rare, running water to one's premises is an impossibility, well-funded public education is unavailable, and the quality of health services, transport facilities, leisure and open spaces, and even good local food markets is low. Investing in infrastructure is therefore an absolute necessity for the new urban agenda. In this regard, Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Agenda, which urges countries to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, could not have come at more auspicious time. Urban areas concentrate economic activities, households, industries and infrastructures which are hotspots for energy consumption as well as key sources of greenhouse gases.\",\"This administrative capital is also expected to attract private business and diverse industries such as health care, welfare, culture and international cooperation and advanced technology. In order to promote balanced location of administrative functions. Ten innovation cities are being developed nationwide, relocating 154 public agencies from the Capital region to the provinces. Innovation cities are constructed to accommodate not only government organisations but also private actors including enterprises and universities, pursuing to create innovative clusters.\",\"At the intra-urban level, the quality of road infrastructure and public transport influences mobility and home-to-work connectivity within the urban perimeter and its adjacent areas. At the inter-urban level, transport infrastructure is essential for urban capacity to attract and retain investment and capital and to develop competitive advantages. The transport sector in Chile has progressed greatly in recent decades: public transportation is more widely available within and between cities and the quality and extension of transport infrastructure has improved.\",\"Pilot programmes and smaller systems have been implemented in Pasig City, Bangkok, Bandung and Delhi (Mateo-Babiano, 2015). Any effort to promote the use of non-motorised transportation should be developed with stakeholder engagement and public participation. Vehicle ownership can be affected through price-based measures, such as additional taxes and fees at purchase or on a recurring basis that are not affected by the intensity of use, or through non-priced-measures such as quotas on vehicle licenses that directly control the number of new vehicles that can be purchased.\",\"Service sector firms more than manufacturing firms appear to benefit from urbanization economies. Clustering makes intra-industry cooperation between firms possible, enabling them to overcome difficulties such as failures of information and of contract enforcement. In Ethiopia the effect on productivity appears high when clustering firms are producing similar products. The effect of clustering in Cambodia is stronger for informal enterprises and manufacturing firms than for service firms.\",\"It is primarily a producer of cereal and vegetable seeds, with a major share of its seed production taking place in other countries around the world. Local farmers who own the co-operative produce wheat and vegetables, and the firm has a large industrial bakery division. The firm is the fourth largest seed exporter in the world and its crop production has a large impact on land use in the hinterland, especially in the Limagne plain where agriculture is dominated by field crops and wheat in particular. The area is also known for the cultivation of sugar beets and has historically had a significant confectionary manufacturing industry that relies on local sugar. On some of the hillier land there has been a revitalisation of the wine industry, but the amount of land in vines remains well below historic high levels.\",\"The holding of free, democratic elections planned for 2016, within the constitutional deadline, is the country’s main political challenge to consolidate the achievements of the democratic process that began in 2006. Urban areas dominate the national economy and offer better living conditions than rural areas. However, there are risks associated with current urbanisation trends in the DRC: an increase in unplanned and informal neighbourhoods, poor quality of urban transport and congestion in cities, and limited access to social infrastructure. The country does not have a national urbanisation strategy, although it does have some measures and ongoing national initiatives which could directly or indirectly contribute to urban development, especially the land-use planning reform, construction projects for special economic zones and agro-industrial parks. It was driven by agriculture, investment, services and an improved business climate.\",\"This process of programming, planning and designing a public space network represents a valuable instrument for the development of cohesive and coherent urban spaces and an important tool for urban planning at a city level. The tools are now being rolled out to six additional cities in 2018: Kathmandu (Nepal), Suleja and Minna (Nigeria), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Johannesburg (South Africa) and Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia). However, there is a great demand from other cities to use this assessment tool to guide the development of citywide public space strategies.\",\"The CODI identifies, plans, implements, manages and coordinates inter-agency priority projects of high impact for the economic development of the state. Inter-agency collaboration is sought to respond to the limitations faced by the CODI related to budgeting and programming functions.

It operates in tandem with the congestion charge, adding an additional fee based on the emissions rating of the vehicle in question. This is the first emission control scheme in the UK to target individual vehicles, and represents an important stepping stone towards an ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ). The T-charge has resulted in a 30% reduction in the number of non-compliant vehicles in the congestion charging zone.\",\"Only 10% of travel between Aix and Marseille is with public transport. Private cars account for 90% of trips within the metropolitan area, close to the level observed in large US metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and Denver.

Article 30 further adds that States Parties shall take measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to sporting and recreational venues. Target 11.7 calls for universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible green and public spaces, in particular for persons with disabilities.\",\"Environmental improvements and land-use reforms in disadvantaged neighbourhoods may actually trigger exclusion by driving property' prices up and attracting wealthier residents while displacing working-class residents (Cowell and Thomas, 2002, Banzhaf and McCormick, 2007, Bunce, 2009, Dale and Newman, 2009, Dooling, 2009, Quastel, 2009, Checker, 2011). This concern is reinforced in brow'nfield areas, where gentrification becomes extremely profitable through the realisation of the rent gap, the difference between actual and potential ground rent (Smith, 1979). Urban regeneration strategies therefore need to strike a careful balance between environmental and socio-economic goals. Designing urban spaces that are “just green enough” requires government authorities, residents and business ow'ners to w'ork together to achieve environmental remediation without environmental gentrification.\",\"Development charges that reflect the true cost of providing services can buttress planning tools by guiding development away from high-cost areas to more efficient locations (Tomalty and Skaburskis, 2003). Pricing policies can be an effective planning tool because “they directly engage developers, they make them accept the full project costs, they recognise and publicise the need to correct for the external costs of development by increasing the cost of land, and they raise funds for infrastructure development and compensation programmes” (Skaburskis, 2003). For example, the extension of the metro-line in Copenhagen was financed through fees from the development of the 0restad area of Copenhagen (OECD, 2009). In order to have the required effect, the charges have to be differentiated by location to reflect the different infrastructure costs.\",\"Mexico’s National Development Plan (PND 2013-2018) with regard to tourism aims to consolidate tourist destinations, create jobs, develop markets for SMEs, and generate new sources of income for the local populations by enhancing investments and financing for tourism, while also promoting sustainability (Gobiemo de la Republica, 2013a). The Plan puts emphasis on the importance of adopting a cross-disciplinary and programme-based approach to government actions, while at the same time considering tourism policy objectives. This is illustrated with tourism objectives being considered in the country’s National Infrastructure Plan 2013-18. The Plan focuses on balanced regional development, urban development and connectivity logistics (Gobiemo de la Republica, 2013b).\",\"Regular, planned and small fare adjustments are preferable. Introducing this practice will be easier if fare adjustments are linked to clearly identifiable quality improvements. Shifting towards higher fares, reflected in higher quality, will be more effective in attracting users than low fares and poor services.\",\"They are subordinate to the PRI in the case of municipalities that comprise a wider urban unit. These plans incorporate different documents and studies, including a review of the socio-economic situation and potential for (industrial) development, as well as feasibility studies for physical expansion, particularly with respect to service delivery. They also articulate the municipality’s urban centres in terms of population and growth potential, roadway hierarchies, including access and service roads, parking requirements, zoning plans, principal urban activities, assess the infrastructure capacity of roads, large structures and areas designated as at high risk for natural hazards or requiring protection, identify buildings classified as national monuments and traditional zones (zoms tipicas), identify historical buildings or zones.\",\"Eight lane city road, 402.

The core responsibilities of the DGT are at national level on all inter-urban roads, except for the Basque Countiy, Catalonia and Navarre.\",\"It elaborated further on SDG 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Unplanned urbanization is causing cities to choke with congested traffic and air pollution, basic services like water and sanitation are not reaching citizens, particularly the poor, joblessness, crime, conflict and social strife are major problems, including in so-called developed countries, and natural disasters are becoming more destructive as people concentrate in dense areas. The relevance of cities in economic terms is absolutely remarkable, considering they occupy only between 3-4% of the world's available landmass.\",\"The results of the inventory have also provided a basis for the district's public space strategy with a focus on heritage preservation. Efforts should be expanded to increase the quality and quantity of public space data, especially in the developing world. A key lesson is the need to link the public space assessments and inventories to the development of citywide public space strategies and action plans for the local governments, which function as the main sources of funding for public space data collection.\",\"Moreover, there is a poor record of civil society participation and partnership in the implementation of plans and strategies that exist to support cultural and heritage preservation. For cities, culture appears as an economic asset, a social good and a productive and dynamic process that undergoes continuous change.*\\\" Many cities around the world contain a historical core with various forms of cultural and natural heritage that have resisted forces of urbanization and modernization.\",\"At first, their terms were limited to two years, but this was later increased to four years.39 Once mayors were elected, and since they now had substantial funds to work with, many innovations and improvements in infrastructure emerged in major Colombian cities. Another good example of decentralization with improved financing in Latin America is Brazil as discussed in Box 1.1. This was the third “moment” of decentralization across the continent — a pattern that was consistent with reforms in other parts of the developing world.40 This period is referred to as one of “democratic decentralization”41 because this was when many African countries genuinely attempted to both devolve powers to local governments, and to democratize the process of local governance. Although there are variations across the continent, the short answer is: not very much.\",\"Municipalities within Gauteng may also support the elaboration of district spatial development plans for each of the planning districts within a metropolitan area, but these tend to be much more detailed plans on specific zoning and development decisions in the near term. Most of the major infrastructure projects in the province have been achieved through intergovernmental co-operation, and this continues to be strengthened and refined. Positive aspects of co-operative governance include intergovernmental plans and planning structures to give effect to the Programme of Action, as well as the implementation of a range of key intergovernmental delivery projects.9 Amongst the most important intergovernmental projects is the development of Gautrain, the multi-billion rand fast-rail link, which connects the major centres of Tshwane and Johannesburg with the O.R. Tambo International Airport in the eastern part of the region. While provincial government negotiated the major portion of government funding for the project, as well as the private-sector investment component, provincial and local government collaborated closely on the design of stations and station precincts.\",\"Namely, EVs are designed to sit parked (and therefore charge over long periods), rather than drive, for the great majority of their time, which makes them less suited for high utilisation. The available charging infrastructure, moreover, was not originally designed for shared use. Given their long charging times, their locations outside of city centres, inside garages and lacking access or amenities, it is clear that EV charging infrastructure was designed for customers and commuters rather than for shared use purposes.\",\"Strategies for increasing the number of smaller housing units can include zoning accessory dwelling units, which can be used to increase the supply of small units. One such example is Manchester’s Urban Cohousing project, which supports a resident-led group for independent flats and communal spaces for older people. A housing relocation system to match housing demand with household size can help satisfy the housing needs of both generations: Older people living in large houses earn income by renting their houses to younger families with children, and moving to accommodation more suitable to later life. The Japan Trans-housing Institute (JTI) helps to connect house owners over 50 years old with families with young children who are looking for rental accommodation (Japan Trans-housing Institute, 2014).\",\"The sessions of the General Meeting can be ordinary (held once a year) and extraordinary (held when the circumstances make this advisable, in the president’s opinion, when the Board of Directors agrees to this or when proposed in writing by one-tenth of the members). A vice-president and a treasurer are designated. All the posts forming the Board of Directors are unremunerated.\",\"Whenever there is a software upgrade or device purchase\\u002freplacement, there is a risk of data loss or incompatible physical or digital formats. Obsolescence and limited preservation of digital heritage can have a significant impact on our lives, but more generally for science, education, culture, for economic and social development and our histories. Assuring the continuity of formats and access over time is becoming a serious problem.\",\"Critics worry that projects that make significant improvements to non-motorised trips compare poorly with those that cut travel time on motorised transport. This is due to the conventional approach to CBA that relies on travel time savings as a proxy for most of the benefits associated with transport investment. This traditional focus on travel time savings often leads to prioritisation of schemes that are misaligned with increased sustainable mobility goals.\",\"The European Union takes part in the work of the OECD. The Centre manages several programmes and initiatives, such as the Local Employment and Economic Development programme and its Trento Centre to support local development capacity, the Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth, the Roundtable of Mayors and Ministers, the Water Governance Initiative, the World Observatory on Subnational Government Finance and Investment, and the National Urban Policy Programme.\",\"India, Pakistan, the Philippines and Viet Nam have a low vehicle share per 1,000 population, ranging from five to 22. Further, motorcycles constitute a maj or share of the vehicle population in cities in South Asia and South-East Asia. India, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam have very high numbers of motorcycles. Growth was between 10-14 per cent in Brunei Darussalam, China, India and Thailand, while the growth was a low 1-2 per cent in Bangladesh, Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines.\",\"The RSF focuses on finding alternatives for adjusting the cost and size of the project. It helps prevent line ministries from deliberately underestimating project costs in the planning stage and prevents project costs from escalating once the project has been initiated. Second, the RDF was introduced in 2006 to prevent overestimation of demand.\",\"Administrative consultation takes place on policies related to the physical environment within the framework of the Multi-annual Programme for Infrastructure, Spatial Planning and Transport (Meeijarenprogramma Infrastructuur, Ruimte en Transport, MIRT). There are also sub-councils of the cabinet (e.g. the Council for Economic Affairs, Infrastructure and Environment [De Raad voor Economische Zaken, Infrastructuur en Milieu]) that address innovation, scientific and research policy and are composed of representatives from higher and academic education institutions and the ministers most closely involved with these areas. By virtue of parliamentary procedure, the minister-president chairs these councils, w'hose members are ministers and state secretaries involved specifically in the policy areas of the councils.\",\"Formerly known as Durban, the city has been praised for a renewal project (Warwick Junction), which has opened spaces to informal businesses such as street vending.17 The new planning approach was a joint cooperative initiative between public officials and organized street vendors, highlighting the suspension of traditional master plans in favour of a more collaborative approach. This included the type of inter-departmental coordination and participatory planning needed for street trading, bringing public agencies, which otherwise work in silos, into collaboration with one another. The municipality also made sure that street vendors and their preferences guided the (low-budget) design, facilitating project ownership.\",\"When they exist, digital maps with municipal-level administrative boundaries are considered a state secretl and not available to foreign researchers and international organisations. Gridded population data from the Landscan project at a fine level of spatial disaggregation - 1 km2 - is used to identify city cores. The identification of core municipalities was made possible thanks to the derivation of municipal boundaries of the 26 FUA cores (i.e. the largest cities in Kazakhstan) from open cartographic resources, such as Open Street Map.\",\"This trend in digitalisation has been accompanied by a reduction of personal customer service in vehicles, terminals, service centres and call centres. This increases the risk of marginalisation for those that those who cannot use mobile devices due to age, disability, language skills, or other reasons. This data should be an integral part of the data package provided by transport operators to MaaS operators and eventually to customers. This data is required by law to be available in machine readable format through open interfaces by 1 January 2018.\",\"Each municipality must ensure that the development (expansion and densification) established by its PRC can be effectively supplied with the necessary public services (i.e. sanitation, transportation, energy infrastructure and other services). The plan is developed and approved by the Municipal Council (Consejo Municipal) after a process of public consultation with the community, including public hearings in those neighbourhoods that might be the most affected by the plan, and with the municipality’s Council of Civil Society Organisations (Consejo Comunal de Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil). After the local government approves the Plan, it must be approved by MINVU’s SEREMI in the region.\",\"Whether formal or informal, these businesses lack the infrastructure, equipment, access to materials and markets which any firm of any size anywhere needs to expand— and create higher quality jobs. The net result is low employment generation in the Colombian capital as a whole, the bulk being in the informal sector. This was confirmed by findings of UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Initiative recently implemented in 23 Colombian cities.39 Technical assistance and strategic, temporary subsidies would enable smaller firms to overcome these obstacles, leveraging them into higher efficiency and breaking the current cycle of low productivity: this is an effective policy to consider. As noted earlier, over 90 per cent of New York businesses employ fewer than 20 staff, but since 2001, 67 per cent of new firms employ fewer than five. High-end New York firms are now mostly located in Brooklyn where fixed costs are lower than in Manhattan, turning New York into “the second Silicon Valley” of the US.\",\"As with shared bicycles, they can be station-based or free-floating. In both instances, data is generated and logged in order to manage payment and system operation. Some systems share this data through APIs that offer some level of integration with third-party service providers. In some instances, car-sharing may be bundled with other mobility services (e.g. agreements between Mobility Car Sharing and the Swiss Federal Railways).\",\"Of internal migrants, 23% reported that employees of citizen service centres (Tsentri obslujivania naselenia) and medical personnel, for instance, took advantage of their lack of local registration to ask for a bribe. Internal migration data is tracked by the Agency for Statistics, using information supplied by the Migration Policy Committee and the Public Service Centres that collect registration records. Unreliable figures for registered migrants pose problems in calculating the real number of people living in a given place. Official statistics do not always reflect the number of people for whom public services are needed.\",\"Therefore, the activities of MSMEs have been identified to negatively impact the environment and could erode their long term economic development. Though progress has been made, there is still a need for more sensitisation and support mechanisms to ensure compliance and commitment to environmental standards. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) together with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as lead executing agency implemented the Promotion of Green Economic Development (ProGED) project.\",\"It is multidimensional nature and the whole spectrum of formality\\u002finformality that should be taken into consideration. What is also required for better policy outcomes is the development of a broader understanding of informal settlement formations. A narrow understanding is when the consideration of informal settlements is dominated by the images from the Third World, poverty and self-made housing areas.\",\"However, further depreciation of the local currency and higher anticipated food prices due to drought are expected to counter the benefits from lower international oil prices and should push inflation to breach the upper end of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) target range of 3-6%. Benefiting from its strong links to South Africa, Namibia attracts more investment than average sub-Saharan countries. However, to accelerate convergence with high-income countries in line with its current National Development Plan, the authorities need to address remaining structural bottlenecks. Having passed a new Public Procurement Law in 2015, work on Public Finance Management law must be speeded up to reinforce economic governance.\",\"These policies will need to be synchronised and implemented in parallel with the initiatives of the Council for Human Capital. These drivers, also called “framework conditions”, are largely endogenous to the region and include agglomeration effects, sectoral specialisation, human capital, accessibility and infrastructure, innovation and institutional factors. To strengthen its regional economy, Morelos w'ill need to leverage its diverse set of assets and comparative advantages by adopting a territorial, comprehensive approach to different challenges.\",\"Data were averaged over 2010-2015. The DfT produced a lookup for LHAs (Local Highway Authorities) to FUAs. Some LHAs might only partially overlap with the FUA, in which case a fraction of their traffic volume is accounted for in the FUA total. This fraction is assumed to be proportional to the spatial overlap, an assumption which of course induces great uncertainty in the results. In two of the FUAs in the United Kingdom, traffic volume data could not be computed because boundary mismatch caused an uncertainty on the traffic volumes which was greater than +\\u002f-30%. This is observed in the vast majority of cities (61 out of 68) where data is provided by gender.\",\"The CLUP and its implementation instrument, the zoning ordinance, are intended to regulate land use as part of a set of plans that span all levels of government. Yet despite the legislative requirement and the guidelines created by Region VII to assist LGUs in developing CLUPs, there is not one completed, updated CLUP. Some LGUs have however stated that the guidelines are overly technical for local government application.\",\"Increasing the use of affordable and reliable energy in remote rural communities can improve their capacity to deliver goods and services. For instance, the availability of reliable electricity is essential for a local restaurant that needs a refrigerator. In rural areas there is often insufficient business to support a full range of services provided through independent firms. A region may not be able to support a full-fledged home repair business, but could make use of the services of a travelling handyman that operates out of a fully-equipped vehicle.\",\"With rising urban emissions, the population around the world will be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Cities themselves will be especially prone to rising sea levels, increasing migration, and water and food stress. Without investment in urban resilience, the effects of climate change will push more urban households into poverty.’\",\"The term was formerly LUZ (larger urban zone). The perimeters used in this report were defined by Eurostat (2015) as part of the Urban Audit 2011-2014. Casualty figures at FUA level were taken from CARE, a database managed by the European Commission's Directorate General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE).\",\"Activities carried out by the CAMe will be supported by federal yearly funds (MXN 42 million in 2015), and a fund integrated with resources allocated by state-level governments from the inspection and maintenance programmes. This mechanism substituted for the funds allocated to the CAM from the gasoline charge. The public enterprise Ruta 100 was dissolved in 1995, mostly because of financial problems, and the industry turned back to private operators.\",\"Examples include concentrations of surgical instrument firms in Sialkot (Pakistan), ceramic tiles in Santa Catarina (Brazil), metal working in Kumasi (Ghana), and wine in Cape Town (South Africa). In Turkey, Gaziantep has undertaken heritage resto-and rehabilitation to revitalize the tourism industry. Dubai is investing in higher education in engineering and information technology. In Tennessee, US, the city of Chattanooga incorporates endogenous development in its multi-faceted economic development-driven city plan prepared in response to loss of manufacturing jobs in the 1980s.\",\"Public spaces are broadly associated with benefits such as enhanced safety and social cohesion, higher equality and improved health and well-being. They increase property values, retail activity multiplication, city attractiveness, and contribute to more effective and efficient transport and mobility. A prosperous city is an inclusive one that provides spaces for social engagement, recreation, social and economic development of vulnerable groups, and fosters social cohesion through the provision of adequate and well-designed public spaces.\",\"However, the efforts of regional authorities to make their case at the national level also seem to play a role in funds allocation, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes. The result is that utility network companies do not have a long-term planning horizon, which leads to underinvestment in municipal utility networks. The national government and local akimats are promoting the installation of meters. For instance, the installation of heating meters for housing buildings can be financed at subsidised, low interest rates through a government financial vehicle, the Public Utilities Development Fund (Fund razvitie JKKh). Differentiated tariffs charging higher fees to consumers without meters are also increasingly common. They provide incentives for homeowners to install meters, but their actual impact on metering coverage varies across regions and subsectors (e.g. district heating, sew'age or water supply).\",\"In addition, according to the 2017 global mobility report,10 mobility should be equitable in access, efficient, safe, and climate responsive. Issues of public-transit-related crimes are identified as key focus areas under this element, which particularly constrain women's mobility and which, in turn, should be tackled. Transport efficiency applied in a macroeconomic perspective implies the optimization of resources—energy, technology, space, institutions and regulations—to generate an efficient transport system or network. For example, it is projected that by 2030, annual global passenger traffic for all modes will exceed 80 trillion passenger-kilometres—a 50 per cent increase compared with 2015 estimates, while an additional 1.2 billion cars will be on the roads by 2030—double the total in 2017.*\\\" Indeed, such exponential growth of transport will have significant socioeconomic impacts on the livelihoods for billions of urban dwellers, and significantly affect the urban environment.\",\"Finally, city governments can ensure that appropriate social protections are available at the local level, especially among the highly disadvantaged. Local institutions are well placed to match the supply and demand of social protection services and ensure their accessibility to the populations concerned. Cities differ widely in their labour force composition and policy efforts therefore need to focus on attracting and retaining workers for different types of jobs- from cutting-edge jobs in the digital economy to more traditional manufacturing jobs and informal jobs. In the case of high-skilled jobs, for example, the city of Lulea in Sweden has combined a set of infrastructure reforms, education initiatives and efficient branding of its natural environmental characteristics to attract Facebook, which is expected to create 2 200 new jobs in the city (Eudes, 2016).\",\"Local Governance in Developing Countries, The World Bank, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. Financing Metropolitan Governments in Developing Countries, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, Massachusetts, pp. Initial Assessment, OECD Development Pathways, OECD Publishing, Paris, http:\\u002f\\u002fdx.doi.org\\u002f10.1787\\u002f9789264246768-cn.

Moreover, “big data” sources, such as cell phone signals, can shed light on people’s mobility in and around cities, which could provide useful information for city planners. Governments need to develop policies and guidelines for the accessibility and use of such new data sources, including safeguards for privacy and confidentiality. Traditional data collection systems on migration, including censuses, surveys and administrative records, should be strengthened.\",\"The national government could oblige municipalities to have an urban development plan when providing investment funds or have access to the resources of the Metropolitan Fund (Fondo Metropolitano). The sustainable use of natural resources, such as water, green areas, and maintaining air quality are crucial for sustainable development and achieving a high quality of life in the region. In the state of Morelos, the abundance of natural amenities is moreover a source of competitive advantage for the tourism sector and the economy of rural areas.\",\"This experience shows how planning and other rules can be turned from forbidding to facilitating and inclusive through participatory decision-making, in the process recognizing the social and economic value of the informal services sector. Ensuring equitable urban development and inclusive growth and empowering civil society are fundamental principles of what the New Urban Agenda should address (Chapter 9). These movements were not just about socio-economic injustice.\",\"In the parts of the city where the poor live, roads are often unpaved, poorly drained and maintained. A study in 18 African cities found that people devoted 8-15 per cent of their total household expenditure to transport, with the poor spending 4-10 per cent of income on transport. Actual spending patterns on transport are, however, complex and often localized.\",\"In Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, Albania and Romania stand out with half of the housing lacking piped water. As in the case of water supply, sewerage services are most problematic in Albania, Romania and the EECCA countries. The data indicate that a limited share of the housing has a bath or shower—Uzbekistan (13.3 per cent), Bosnia and Herzegovina (22 per cent), Kyrgyzstan (24 per cent) and the Republic of Moldova and Turkmenistan (30 per cent).\",\"The CPI also helps to define targets and goals that can support the formulation of evidence-based policies, including the definition of city visions and long-term plans that are both ambitious, and measurable. This framework allows for periodic assessments of the various dimensions of urbanization and the overall conditions of cities. Still, it is for governments to define the scope, frequency and form of the monitoring and reporting, enabling policy-makers to measure progress and identify areas for improvement, including capacity-building needs. Such monitoring will also enable public authorities to identify potential setbacks and constraints, thus pre-empting unintended consequences. In order to avoid overload and duplication in national and local monitoring and reporting, including the potential for double counting, it is recommended to adopt common metrics and methodologies with a unified global platform. The CPI works as a support for multi-scale decision-making, connecting the city with the region and the overall country.\",\"Cultural and other factors affect the willingness of employers and employees to try FWAs. Company cultures may also affect these attitudes (Komarraju, 2006). Trust between employers and employees is critical to the success of FWAs, with traditional forms of oversight augmented or replaced by output-based evaluations of performance. In some countries, the private sector (and multinational firms in particular) has taken the lead on the issue.\",\"The benefits can further increase if the public-transport-oriented policies are combined with the car-deterrence policies. This combination of these policies would also prove successful for middle-size and smaller cities. The availability of public transport, as an alternative to car mobility, attracts motorists to give up their cars for urban transfers. This relation is the stronger the larger and more congestion-prone an urban area is, although this rule can also apply to main traffic corridors for mid-size and smaller cities.\",\"Policies towards industrial symbiosis (IS) can be an effective means to reduce waste and promote reuse among industries in Metro Cebu especially when applied to Economic Zones. Industrial symbiosis, a value chain approach for eco-innovation, helps create a cyclical manufacturing loop for industries in close geographical proximity to exchange by-products (Gibbs, 2008, Chertow and Park 2016). Industrial symbiosis deems the by-product\\u002fwaste of one industry as resources\\u002finputs for the other allowing for innovation, cost reductions, increased revenues and above all, additional economic prospects in an environmentally conscientious manner. Symbiotic networks can develop spontaneously or be planned. Kawerau, New Zealand is applying this concept to reduce its carbon footprint by closing the loop between its wood processing centres and its geothermal energy industries (Embracechange, 2014). Similarly, in Landskrona, Sweden, though an organic synergy existed among some operational industries, its full potential was realised in 2003 when the government assisted with an agreement to collaborate and catalyse IS development leading to the establishment of the Landskrona industrial symbiosis programme (Chertow and Park 2016).\",\"In the United States, city and regional planning, land use management, and implementation of urban planning principals are predominantly undertaken by state and municipal governments. The US federal government structure assigns most responsibilities to state governments, other than those which are reserved for the federal government, including constitutional issues, inter-state issues, and foreign affairs, foreign trade, defence, military, etc. This allows for both local and direct rule - where decision makes are more directly connected to the residents they serve, allowing them to be better aware of local conditions and more responsive to local needs and concerns. This also allows for a variety of initiatives, policies, and levers to be developed.\",\"Each sub-region is given a weight ranging from 1 to 5 for every indicator, with the numbers representing increasing level of performance. There are, however, huge variations in the levels of participation for each activity per region. For example, while participatory budgetary scores least in the Australia and New Zealand subregion (1\\u002f5), it is quite common in the LAC subregion (3.05\\u002f5). Results show that 48 per cent of the cities (107) engaged civil society prior to the three processes, 34 per cent (75 cities) did not engage civil society in any of the process and 18 per cent (39 cities) engaged them in at least one process.\",\"For example, culture can be used to increase political and economic power of vulnerable groups such as women, youth and indigenous groups, and operationalized to support and enable the achievement of sustainable development in cities. Second, culture promotes economic development, driving social and economic change, and increasing development potential for transformative change.\\\"\\\" Third, culture supports planning, infrastructure and the making of public space by providing local knowledge about cities and its citizens, and adding a sociocultural importance to planning and policy using culturally sensitive urban data.\",\"However, taking advantage of these new data sources needs investments in staff training and in systems for integrating geospatial, and earth observation data and ensuring interoperability. Advances in technology or technical human capabilities will only deliver their potential as part of integrated systems that align the flow of information with the shifting needs and demands of users. There can also be measures at the regional level.\",\"To make things worse, they often face unpredictable waiting times. The government of the Federal District has recognised the many challenges posed by CETRAM and the need for a strategy to improve them. In turn, private parties pay a financial compensation to the Federal District government. In the State of Mexico, the concept of CETRAM is less developed, and no institutional framework or overall strategy exists for co-ordination with private operators or between governmental agencies for modernisation of transfer centres.\",\"Mapping, GPS tracking and widely accessible mobile data have the potential to improve spatial efficiency and the way urban residents interact with public transit, transport congestion, the real estate market and monetary transactions. In Africa ICT is already enhancing urban-rural linkages, supporting the co-development of cities and their hinterlands through better market information, better access to services and easier cash transfers. The pattern of growth of African cities will no doubt be shaped by new technology. Incentives for dense and compact development fall as transport, trade and communication over longer distances become easier. But as density decreases, negative externalities (costs borne by society) increase, including congestion, pollution, segregation, infrastructure costs, loss of walkable commercial districts and the costs associated with public transit viability. Only those with cars and smart phones?\",\"Some studies have shed light on the extent to which various social groups have access to well-specified facilities, or what facilities certain segments of the population need and want in close proximity. According to the exhaustive overview of Lee and Moudon (2008) grocery stores stand out as the most visited neighbourhood destination. Likewise, Paez, Scott and Morency (2012) found that shopping and health facilities were the most important destinations to have within short distances.\",\"The results are unclear for urban traffic. Discouraging the ownership of motorbikes may lead to a reduction in the number of vehicles, but could also worsen traffic congestion if more cars are used as a result rather than alternative modes of transportation (Phang, 2014). This issue may be particularly relevant in low- and middle-income economies, where motorbikes and scooters are popular modes of transportation.\",\"In addition, many ministries have specific urban policy functions. The average OECD member country government had 6.7 ministries or national-level departments or agencies with explicit urban policy functions in mid-2013, and many had 8 or more. While 18 OECD countries still had no overall framework in place in mid-2013, a number were under preparation and in a number of other countries, urban policy was rolled into broader regional or spatial development strategies.\",\"These models may include formal business-to-consumer services (commercial car-sharing, micro-transit, bicycle and scooter sharing), peer-to-peer models for sharing the use of cars or that enable the sourcing of rides, platform-based business models that connect passengers and drivers (or goods and carriers) and hybrid models that combine aspects of some or all of those approaches (Shaheen et al., This is especially true for transport authorities that are operating or contracting\\u002fprocuring services from relatively stable and established public transport operators. Analogue bicycle-sharing systems have been around for decades but the arrival of IT-enabled, automated bicycle-sharing systems has led to massive growth.\",\"When the agency in charge of the underground (STC) was created in 1967, the federal government funded its expansion and operational subsidy. After the 1997 reform, the government of the Federal District assumed responsibility for the underground system (Medina, 2013).32 As a consequence, under the current framework, the Federal District has to provide the operational subsidy for the underground in the State of Mexico, and is also responsible for the maintenance and management of this infrastructure (Medina, 2013). This is far from ideal, since better connections for population in the State of Mexico necessarily mean higher financial pressure for the Federal District, which is already operating the underground at a deficit.\",\"In the present report, these types hove been aggregated into the three piliors of sustainable development: social, economic ond environmental (see clso UNECE, 2012). Transport systems should be also affordable for societies, therefore, public expenditure in a sustainable form as well as alternative funding options should be also evaluated. In order to evaluate transport safety, particularly in the road sector, the current situation, trends and controlling factors (e.g. speeding and drink-driving) of traffic accidents should be assessed. Finally, transportation negatively affects the environment through the consumption of non-renewable fuels, local and GHG emissions, noise and ecosystem degradation.\",\"From 2011, MINVU carried out several reforms to improve the targeting of the project. Neighbourhood selection is based on a system that combines the selection of priority zones based on a set of social and housing vulnerability indicators (both quantitative and georeferenced), and bottom-up municipal demand within the priority zones. The final selection of the qualifying zones is made by a jury composed by the intendente, SERVIU, MINVU, GORE, a representative from the Chilean Association of Municipalities, SEREMI.\",\"The City Prosperity Index is a composite index based on six dimensions and over 15 subdimensions that are contextually specific and globally comparable. The dimensions are infrastructure development, productivity, quality of life, equity and social inclusion, environmental sustainability, governance, and legislation. The City Prosperity Initiative incorporates new analytical tools based on spatial indicators that facilitate a systematic disaggregation of information along with the key dimensions of urban development.\",\"On the side of local liberty, the Girondins’ Constitution of 1793 demanded universal suffrage at the local level and total decentralisation—but it was never implemented. It was the Jacobins who eventually gained dominance and established a centralised republican State with a long reach. With the decree of December 4, 1793 departements lost powers that had been briefly granted to them only a few years earlier (but were never implemented). Under Napoleon this centralisation continued, the departemental structure of 1790 was retained and the powerful position of prefet in departements ensured State control over local matters (Schmidt, 2007: 23).\",\"The information supply sub-system gives the motorists information on congestion, travel times, traffic regulations, and parking space. Finally, the operation management subsystem operates traffic control system within a prefecture, provides supervisors at the traffic control centre with the information on the traffic situation and on the condition of other subsystems, and exchanges information with the information collecting subsystems in other prefectures. Within its ITS policy, other initiatives were developed in line with the UTMS to promote further use of technology and aggregate services for motorists that they can access from a single on-board unit (OBU).\",\"Korea's rural regions are highly specialised in tradable sectors. The share of tradable goods and services represented 58% of the region’s Gross Value Added in 2016, 9% higher than the national average of 49%. By 2016, manufacturing alone explained over two-fifth of the rural regions' GVA and therefore it was higher than the national average (41% compared to 31%). These can be divided into two categories: rural regions specialised in tradable sectors and rural regions more specialised in non-tradable sectors. The economy of three (Chungcheongnam-do, Gyeonsangbuk-do and Jeollanam-do) out of five rural regions is specialised in tradable goods and services sectors, since these sectors explains more than half of the GVA of the regions. On the other side, the rest two rural regions (Gangwon-do and Jeju-do), are specialised in non-tradable activities.\",\"The Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, an ad hoc mixed-sector, non-profit organisation, managed most of these projects. Overall, USD 350 million of real estate value was either renovated or created, generating 1 000 jobs. According to the local government, the overall Columbus Commons projects’ USD 388 million public infrastructure investment was offset by private investment amounting to close to USD 2 billion. The city reportedly created an additional 1 600 jobs through that effort.\",\"By downscaling the model proposed by the province of Potenza, and with its support, these municipalities are locally implementing a multi-stakeholder approach. This is based on the active involvement of local institutions, organizations and associations representing different professional and social categories, to give them the opportunity to become driving forces reducing disaster risk. These municipalities are engaged in clustering processes with key community actors across all sectors. They are also looking at working with the concept of social categories, experimenting with the use of concrete plans\\u002factions to transform different social groups into forces for developing and implementing safe and sustainable urban policies.\",\"The Implementation Plan for the Sustainable Communities Consortium was adopted on 30 May 2014. This is a crucial condition to building an inclusive urban transport network since lower income households are more likely to live far from economic centres and to rely on public transport. As a consequence, many cities have implemented reforms to respond to this new demand. The creation of transport authorities that are responsible for multiple jurisdictions within a functional urban area is increasingly common.\",\"The metropolitan area acts as an Environmental Authority and has created a Metropolitan Environmental Council. It has established a Transport Authority, in charge of mass public transport, in particular the bus, rail, metro and metrocable systems in the Medellin area. The metropolitan area also promotes co-ordination across levels of government to align development objectives.\",\"Genuine change based on critical self-reflection will be required. That means changes in how we behave, not just superficial adjustments to existing processes, systems and formats (2009). Accordingly, the South African intergovernmental system is being reconfigured to foster alignment with the new national performance management system that is at the heart of the new government’s focus on improving service delivery that includes 12 outcome indicators (Box 3.2). This builds upon a series of legislative measures to stimulate intergovernmental co-operation.\",\"Policies in land use, housing, transportation and sustainability could be strengthened if an integrated approach to their development and implementation were adopted. The current land-use planning system could better contribute to efficient urban development if the zoning system were made more flexible, if infill development was more strongly incentivised, and if there were a national framework for designating and developing natural-hazard risk zones in urban areas. Revisiting these policies is an important step in creating and implementing a national urban vision. It then examines relevant practices in OECD countries, and recommends policy changes that national policy makers may wish to consider when designing a national urban policy framework.\",\"The city penalises traffic law offences through cameras installed in areas with frequent parking violations and cameras mounted on buses monitor parked cars. If a car remains in a “no parking” zone for longer than five minutes, a parking ticket is automatically issued and sent to the car’s owner (about 3 million tickets are issued every year). Front-facing cameras on buses ensure that private cars that use the dedicated “median” bus lanes are also fined. The revenue from parking tickets is then reinvested in improvements of public parking facilities. The city government does not make any direct economic profit out of the export, since private companies are in charge of developing the hardware and software required for implementing TOPIS elsewhere. The financial burden is particularly salient in Korea where local governments have a relatively low fiscal autonomy to start with.\",\"It has a planned capacity of 35 cubic metres per second (m3\\u002fs), of which tw'o-thirds will result in “safe to handle” water and one-third in water that can be drained into rivers and dams (see CONAGUA, 2015). Given the plant's location, the benefit of the plant will be outside the Valle de Mexico. The raw sewage is appreciated by the farmers, as it significantly increases yield for crops.\",\"The case of Singapore, which is at the forefront in building technology-driven traffic management mechanisms in ASEAN, provides some noteworthy examples. Based on most recent information, the expressway and tunnel networks that form part of the ITS stretches about 164 km with a total lane length of 1107 km (LTA, 2018). It is equivalent to about 12% of the total length of road lanes in the country, incorporating arterial, collector and local roads. Notable thoroughfares included are the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway, Marina Coastal Expressway, Central Expressway, Fort Canning Tunnel and Woodsville Tunnel.\",\"What is essential about these is that they have the potential to put a value on urban amenities and the benefits of agglomeration. They can therefore discourage greenfield development while raising revenue for urban services that can help further mitigate the negative externalities of agglomeration, such as public transport to reduce congestion and green spaces to mitigate higher densities. Many cities in the OECD, particularly in North America, impose development fees on new developments to cover the costs of new infrastructure.\",\"Land use forms a critical pillar of the plan which aims to introduce and seek approval for spatial plans in each of Metro Cebu’s 13 LGUs. At this stage, it is uncertain how many of Metro Cebu’s 13 LGUs have approved their respective spatial plan (Table 2.1). It is equally unclear the extent to which these local administrations will influence the development of their relevant comprehensive land use plans (CLUPs) based on the JICA roadmap land-use plan.\",\"It will also affect policy makers' mind set and encourage them to develop cities in a more sustainable way. In addition, the VGGAP assigns relevant ministries and provinces to submit an implementation report to MPI every year. However, the VGGS and VGGAP do not mention how to measure progress, there is no clear instruction on w'hat information these reports should entail and what data should be collected and reported.\",\"A major change at the municipal (and provincial) level is the adoption of one plan for the entire territory that will incorporate all applicable zoning regulations and pertinent administrative laws. All existing zoning plans will be transferred to the environmental plan and local governments will have a period of ten years to transform them. It is anticipated that some areas will have a high degree of protection, such as heritage sites, while others will have far fewer rules and constraints and be more open to experimental uses and spaces.\",\"Note by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union: The Republic of Cyprus is recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.

Core companies are not necessarily the best managers of these municipal utility networks and may not invest adequately in repair and maintenance, given low' utility rates and the anticipated asset transfer to local administrations. The central government could consider designing a specific framework to speed up such asset transfers in monotowns where core companies still own municipal utility networks. The central government could co-finance municipal network repair along with the core company, on condition that municipal utility networks are transferred to the local administration. It w-as ranked among the top 10 economies, of 190 economies surveyed, that showed the most improvement in the 2017 Doing Business report (World Bank, 2016).\",\"Although NRPs may lack enforcement power, defining such goals and tools should certainly bring in more coherence and help NRPs achieve their complex goals. A wide stream of this literature emphasises the key role of institutions in the efficiency of collective action. Ostrom (2005) underlines that the effects of the size of the protected area and the heterogeneity of appropriators on the outcomes of the protected area are unclear. There is a need to evaluate NRPs on these important elements to know how they could be improved. Natural Regional Parks and environmental zoning (cont.) The stated goals of a natural park may be conflictual to specific stakeholders’ interests, but they may also be contradictory or at least mitigated by other policies such as local uiban planning instruments or other environmental measures.\",\"Nevertheless, the data show that road density might reflect also the area and population of the country23, its physiography and demography (see, for example, the relatively low road density in Canada, Australia, Norway and Finland and the Russian Federation), as well as various other factors related to social and economic development. It is interesting to note that although an increasing trend of road density with the Human Development Index (HDI)26 might be discerned at the national level (Fig ure 3.2), there is not, however, a strong correlation.

According to the initiative’s 2014-15 annual report, the group had an annual budget of around USD 3.7 million, which was allocated to programme costs, administrative costs, community capacity building and special events. It has historically relied on loans from organisations, including a USD 2 million loan from the Ford Foundation and USD 1.4 million from the Riley Foundation to acquire vacant lots and reconvert them.\",\"In an urban policy environment characterised by high levels of uncertainty, such indicators and targets can provide a tool for identifying the specific assets for development in different communities and maximising a city’s potential for overall progress. More than 40 separate indicators across administrative, survey and census data sources span seven “domains” of deprivation: employment, income, health, crime, education, living environment and barriers to services. The IMD were initially built at the district ward level in 2000, then at the smaller scale of 32 482 “lower-layer super-output areas” of roughly 1 500 residents in 2004, 2007 and 2010. Most of the statistics used in the latest edition (2010) are from 2008, and new' indices were expected to be produced in 2015.\",\"The space should allow some flexibility in its use to suit changing needs.

According to the Institute for Migrant and Ethnic Studies in a 2008 study, the initiative had accompanied about 150 start-ups, out of which 73% survived their seed phase. However, auditing of the association has pointed out the need to further knowledge and know-how in the fields of financial management and fiscal matters.\",\"In addition, from 2000 to 2010, the private vehicle fleet grew by more than 58% in Chile (INE, 2011,2005, 2003). This was paralleled by a rise in the percentage of total trips made in private transport versus public transport (CEPAL, 2012). In common with most of Chile’s larger cities,31 these trends are leading to greater road congestion and elevated pollution levels. In 2006 on average, approximately 54% of the daily motorised trips in the Santiago metropolitan region were made on public transport (bus, metro, collective taxis).32 If daily commuting is disaggregated by income, results show that the lower-income segments are still highly dependent on public transport (CEPAL, 2012).\",\"The major obstacle to local borrowing is the absence of reliable medium-term and long-term budget planning at the local level, because of the uncertainty surrounding the government policy concerning the allocation of taxes between the national and local budgets and the rate of budget withdraw'als (Makhmutova, 2006). Quotas for annual local borrowing and total local debt are fixed annually by the Budget Law. In 2009, the government determined new' subnational government borrowing limits (in a given fiscal year, annual payment and debt servicing costs were not to exceed 10% of the local budget revenues, and total debt 75% of local budget revenues).\",\"Academic tutoring: tutoring sessions focus on homework and study assignments, as well as prepared exercises and other learning activities to help students develop as competent learners.

Tutoring volunteers are supervised by Pathways staff and come from a range of professional, educational and ethnic backgrounds, although most are university students.\",\"However, further actions are needed to enhance smart trade between Mae Sot and Myawaddy. First, both governments are strongly urged to establish a single window to facilitate customs procedures and documentation by implementing an electronic data exchange system for all stakeholders. Second, dry ports, which contain logistical facilities such as container depots, yards, and truck terminals, can be developed, particularly at the Mae Sot side. Third, labour movement facilitation is needed to supervise migration and to enhance the working conditions of Burmese workers in Thailand. Fourth, a formal framework is needed to officially allow Thai electricity companies to export electricity across the border and the Myawaddy firms to use it. Fifth, the SEZs surrounding the border crossing are still at the first stage of their development, and a Cross-border Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) could be jointly developed to enhance smart trade, taking into account their comparative advantages, endowments, and strengths.\",\"The difficulty lies in striking a balance between securing the participation of incumbent operators in a more regulated system and ensuring that conditions offered to operators do not compromise financial sustainability. Negotiations on bus reform are particularly challenging since incumbent operators have political clout and, as has happened in Rio de Janeiro, can potentially suspend all services to put pressure on the authorities. The negotiations with operators of Mexibus failed to incorporate enough microbus owners into the new system or to relocate them into feeder routes. Nonetheless, ensuring inclusion of incumbent operators also came at a significant cost for the project.\",\"All the information can then be used on a metropolitan-wide platform. Data collection should take advantage of future fare integration initiatives to collect information on whole origin-destination travel, rather than trip segments only. Solid models based on long-term population and employment trends should be developed and used to decide on the projects that should be included in the mobility plans.\",\"A light-rail transit system and policies for relocating housing to the urban core have created policy synergies that increase the use of public transport through a compact urban form. Toyama’s comprehensive approach was successful in improving mobility and increasing the flow of people to the urban core (Toyama City, 2014). The principles set out in the recommendation are grouped in three thematic areas (Box 3.4).

Under the TPCM, the project is not allowed to increase construction size through design modification (unless it is inevitable), construction costs are not interchangeable between project phases or between construction units, and any project adjustment deemed inevitable must be subject to consultation between the ministry in charge of the project and the MOSF. The MOSF is responsible for conducting the PFS and it is evaluated by the PIMAC within the KDI (Public and Private Infrastructure Investment Management Center within the Korea Development Institute), an independent evaluation authority established in 2005.\",\"The population growth was also marked in five cities that are oblast capitals (Brest, Gomel, Grodno, Mogilev and Vitebsk) and in almost all cities of regional significance (\\u003e 50,000 people).

At the same time, these settlements account for only 7 per cent of all urban settlements in the country.\",\"The PPRn can cover a single natural hazard or multiple hazards, and can cover one or more municipalities. Its prohibitions and restrictions on construction in natural-hazard areas apply to all construction, both public and private-sector. While the PPRn are created by the national government, they are developed in close consultation with regional and municipal officials, and the public. Beyond specifying construction conditions, the PPRn are intended to inform land-use planning decisions in areas vulnerable to natural hazards.\",\"In this regard, the mobilization of the diverse potential of small and medium-sized cities and their surrounding territories is important, since small and medium-sized cities make up 94 per cent of the country’s urban settlements and are more evenly distributed throughout the country’s territory in contrast to the more peripheral location of oblast cities. They represent a backbone of the country’s urban settlement system.\",\"This project consisted in upgrading infrastructure, providing housing improvement loans and building capacity in four selected cities which led to the upgrading of 295 low-income areas, benefiting 2.5 million people. This demonstrated the benefits of a more flexible approach to informality, and of trying to enable people to stay in their homes through upgrading. Following the success of the project, the government upscaled it in 2009 into the National Urban Upgrading Programme to 2020. The programme covers 95 cities of Class IV and above, which has reached 90 000 households, servicing unplanned housing areas and providing financial assistance for housing improvement and tenure regularisation (World Bank, 2015b).\",\"The rationales behind the Regional Development Investment Agreement are to enhance the local governments’ autonomy and capacity on their own regional development agenda and to break the policy silos among central ministries which dominate regional policies through sectoral approaches. In order to meet the goal of improving the efficiency of policies and the regional autonomy, the new agreement system is equipped with powerful tools. Financially, large amounts (approximately 15 billion KRW for each pilot region) of government support will cover 30-80% of the costs of projects in the agreements over up to 3 years.\",\"Because the individual commune, or group of communes, is ultimately charged with developing the actual land use legislation that governs changes in land uses, it has to find a way to balance conflicting signals from higher levels of government with the pressures from the local populace to maintain or change the use of particular parcels of land. Typically, rural communes do not have staff with strong competences in land use planning, which makes this an even greater challenge. While consultants can be hired to provide planning support this can also be problematic, because while the consultant may understand the approach of the higher level in spatial planning, they may lack a strong understanding of the local milieu and offer advice that is controversial locally.\",\"Funding for monitoring is needed to pilot test several global tools that monitor and report on the involvement and participation of various stakeholders and at various sub-national and national levels. Many national statistical organisations need capacity building and additional support to establish relevant reporting lines\\u002fchannels and systems for reporting on this indicator. This includes sensitizing authorities to working with different groups, support engaging communities, running and advertising community consultations, and drawing concrete feedback and next steps from consultations.\",\"Nonetheless, the transition to a modem, growth-oriented regional policy is incomplete. There is still a tension between the need for sustained federal support to very poor regions and the desire to foster the emergence of growth poles that might aid economic diversification but might also reinforce inter-regional disparities. In reality, most regions (and most citizens) fall between these two groups.\",\"There are considerable differences within the UNESCWA region in terms of road density, both in the per capita and spatial dimensions. The proportion of paved roads is above 50 percent in all countries with available data (2010). Road density in Asia and the Pacific continues to increase, but remains low in comparison to more developed regions of the world. From 2005 to 2011, the road spatial density in Asia and the Pacific increased from 25 to 38 km of road per 100 km2 of land area, an increase of 50.1 per cent compared to a global growth of 10 per cent over the same period.\",\"For these reasons governments should refrain from over-zoning and constraining the density of urban development, while still providing well-located industrial land and space for streets. Government intervention is also needed to foster social mixing and to reduce barriers between communities, including provision of affordable housing in a range of urban locations. Weak transport connections between industries and workers harm industrial productivity and job seekers.\",\"At the same time, they may feel intimidated by ride services that combine technological elements that they may poorly master and the need to provide banking details in advance. In cities where frequent accessible buses and on-street hail taxis are available, this would mean ensuring that ride services licensed by public authorities provide services as accessible as those they complement or replace and that drivers are sufficiently trained. This may mean a substantial number of vehicles deployed would meet international accessibility standards. On-going monitoring of these outcomes is necessary.\",\"Optimum use of land resources and more opportunity for urban-rural linkage - Conservation of farmlands - Higher quality of life due to and natural biodiversity more recreational activities - Fewer CO2 emissions due to shorter food travel mileage  - Rural economic development (urban agriculture, renewable energy, etc.) Better access to a diversity of local services and jobs - - Higher quality of life due to access to local services (shops, hospitals, etc.) They also can reduce automobile dependency through more economically viable public transport systems and by encouraging the use of walking, cycling and public transport.\",\"The Ministry of National Economy (MNE) is the lead co-ordinator, overseeing physical and economic development, and the cities of regional importance must also develop local programmes. The city PTDs can be approved by the maslikhats only one month after the approval of the oblast PTD.

Ministers who are not members of a sub-council can attend their sessions. Each of the ministers can request a decision of a sub-council to be presented to the full cabinet. This interdepartmental preparation occurs through official co-ordination committees, the so-called “official anterooms”.\",\"As large food retailers tend to have the most power in processed food value chains, the institutional framework and infrastructure to support each of the linkages in the food value chain are essential to supporting domestic food production. Working with lead firms in this area has the potential to be a powerful policy lever.

This is a hallmark of the transformation of humans’ economic base and social structure, inasmuch as, previously, populations lived and worked primarily in rural areas. By concentrating people, investment and resources (a process known as agglomeration), cities heighten the possibilities for economic development, innovation and social interaction. More specifically, cities also make it possible to lower unit costs so as to provide public services such as water and sanitation, health care, education, electricity, emergency services and public recreational areas (Polese, 2009, Satterthwaite, 2010). Along these lines, cities also face challenges that threaten their efforts to achieve sustainability, for example, through improvement of access to, and efficiency in the use of, public services, as well as reduction of their ecological footprint and financial fragility, and the building of resilience against the adverse impact of natural hazards.\",\"This is known as infill development. However, while infill development is allowed in Chilean cities, private-sector developers, which account for 80% of urban investment, tend to find greater returns on investment in undeveloped land outside urban cores. One important tool is to increase the flexibility of zoning, in part through conditional planning.\",\"It is highly unlikely that Blade Runner will provide an accurate portrayal of life in Los Angeles—or that of any other major metropolitan area, for that matter—in 2019. However, reality does tend to imitate art. Major projects within existing urban centres2 or entirely new satellite cities are inspired by high-profile city investments in Dubai, London and Singapore, with significant private-sector involvement. These developments and commercial centres include Hope City, a US$10 billion development to be built outside Accra in Ghana, and Tatu City, a development planned on coffee-producing land outside Nairobi (Figure 11.2). However, the benefits to the urban population currently living in informal settlements in prime locations near urban centres are unclear. Public investment in these new projects may leave less cash for basic infrastructure and services and could accelerate further social and spatial segregation.\",\"Yet the process to privatise and, by extension, uibanise ejidal land is cumbersome, requiring: i) the measurement and allocation of parcels to each ejidatario, ii) the conversion of parcel rights into private property rights, requiring the approval of a majority of the ejidatarios-, iii) confirmation that nobody with a legal right of preference (e.g. family member of an ejidatario) objects to the transfer or wishes to purchase the land, and iv) sale of land. Given the extent of ejido land in Mexico, the complexities of its urbanisation process represent a significant obstacle to legal and well-planned private development, encouraging circumvention of the law, these complexities have also made the process vulnerable to corruption. This has permitted the appropriation of land by real estate developers and the illegal construction of housing in land that may not be suitable for construction.\",\"The pilot is limited to 100 participants who are either parking pass subscribers or non-parking pass subscribers. Parking pass subscribers receive free trips to and from the station and non-parking pass subscribers will be charged a flat USD 2 rate per ride.

According to the New Climate Economy Report, a shift to more compact urban growth, connected infrastructure, and coordinated governance has the potential to “reduce urban infrastructure capital requirements by more than US $3 trillion over the next 15 years”.\",\"Accordingly, cities have become increasingly important policy targets for national governments. These plans are then implemented by three levels of government: national, provincial and local (district and ward level). However the initial planning decisions are taken by the central government, which then inform the lower levels of planning.\",\"There are also significant opportunities for disaster risk reduction, response and reconstruction in cities including through land use planning, building codes and regulations, risk assessments, monitoring and early warning, and building-back-better response and reconstruction approaches. The response of cities to the challenges of climate change has been fragmented, and significant gaps exist between the rhetoric of addressing climate change and the realities of action on the ground. The critical factor shaping urban responses to climate change is government capacity, which is hindered by factors that are institutional, technical, economic, or political in character. In developing countries, where resources are particularly limited, municipal authorities might be hesitant to invest in climate change adaptation given the many competing issues on their urban agendas.\",\"Related to the issue of capacity, there is a threat that major investment decisions taken by the MIRT are dominated by provincial territorial interests and the major cities such as Amsterdam, as opposed to smaller locales (Zonneveld and Evers, 2014: 71). Decentralisation of competencies needs to be accompanied by the appropriate fiscal provisions. It is anticipated that the national government will provide funds for training to assist municipalities and water boards to implement the new act and adjust to new ways of working.\",\"According to estimations presented in the “Columbus 2050” report of the Uiban Land Institute, the tax revenue to acre ratio and the land value to acre ratio is higher for mixed-use projects.

The Bandung Command Centre in Bandung, Indonesia, can be a good model (Box 4.7). Currently, a lot of data is missing that is needed to assess the environmental status and performance of the region (e.g., there is no recent air quality data available, while increasing commuting trips and motorisation suggests air pollution may become more severe in the near future). In addition, where data is available, it is often only at the scale of local authorities, or at the broader scale of the Johor State, which is insufficient for any accurate analysis of the policy needs.\",\"Parking problems are growing both as a result of, increased car commuting (about 80 000 cars per day within the SCoT territory'), but, also as tourism increases in volume and adds additional demands for parking spaces. The SCoT provides general indications related to the question of transport and mobility but, it does not give operational solutions, especially in terms of collective transport. In the end, the Pole metropolitain does not have a clear common transport policy because this is an issue that is best managed at a larger geographic scale such as the region or nation.\",\"For the more developed regions, the urban population has been exceeding the rural one already since 1950 (figure 2.2.) Both of these trends show uninterrupted continuation since 1950. The latter ones saw urban population exceeding in number the rural population in late 1950 in Central and Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia and only in mid-1980 in South Eastern Europe. The situation in the sub regions is nevertheless impacted by its most populous countries, like e.g. the South-Eastern Europe byTurkey. Most of these countries have been seeing decreases in both rural and urban population, with the latter one being even steeper, which resulted in lower rates of urbanization in 2010 compared with 1990. The explanation for such a development can be the migration of population related with the collapse of the communist system and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990, and in later years, for countries that joined the European Union, the job migration to Western Europe and for the Eastern European and Central Asian countries, the job migration to Russian cities.\",\"Policies targeting spatial investments should on this basis consider not just national but regional economic geography. Good urban-rural linkages, in the form of infrastructure and institutional support, can therefore help input-intensive sectors to flourish. Consequently, providing serviced and viable secondary-city alternatives may give mature firms better locational options.\",\"As a possible consequence demand for public transport is higher in Rome. The other differences are relatively more congested roads, less bicycle use and relatively higher fares in Riga versusTallinn. While the congestion should speak in favor of Riga in attracting demand for public transport, the already mentioned ITS and the cheaper fares seem to attract more users to public transport in Tallinn even despite more popularity of cycling for transfers. The combination of better accessibility at a lower fare may be crucial in this context.\",\"With respect to the impact of AVs on personal vehicles, 54% of experts believe that AVs will increase overall vehicle use, namely by reducing travel and parking costs and by providing a mobility option to those who are too young or too old to drive. Of these, most (81%) indicated that such an increase should be limited, which could be most effectively accomplished by promoting car sharing and increasing vehicle usage costs. Thirty percent believe that AV use will decrease overall vehicle use due to the fact that autonomous cars will be more efficient at completing the tasks that drivers usually perform, as well as the fact that riders are likely to engage in more car-sharing in the future.\",\"While governments are the most important actors in metropolitan area governance, they are not the only ones. Therefore, the condition does not rale out that other actors, such as the business community or representatives of the civil society, be represented on the governance body. In some countries, organisations that were created explicitly for the purpose of metropolitan area governance have the status of a full local government.\",\"Unified territory implies promotion of a peaceful unification and the establishment of a co-operative relationship between the South and the North. The balanced growth approach aimed at reducing disparities between regions and at favouring decentralisation from the Capital Region. ( First, the Multi-functional Administrative City, otherwise known as Sejong City, is constructed to form a self-supporting city of 500 thousands inhabitants by 2030 and a home to many of newly migrated central government ministries and institutions.\",\"From 2006-2014, urban social cohesion contracts focused on neighbourhoods in difficulty. The 2015-2020 city contracts act on a wide range of levels, organised around three pillars: development of economic activities and employment, social cohesion, and living conditions and urban renewal. The city contracts established within the City Policy are exemplary for the role that they give to the inhabitants of the target inter-municipalities and cities, which are represented by citizen councils.\",\"However, not all constructions (e.g. individual housing units) have projects and EIA to be submitted for state examination. Criteria for obtaining financial support by private contractors need to include an assessment of the location of new development and its environmental impact. Attracting investment for urban development is difficult if the city cannot supply a reliable transport system.\",\"This leads to local farmers being willing to sell their land for development, especially if they do not have an heir who wants to farm. The government of France has established a national program SAFER to purchase farmland when it comes up for sale to help existing farmers increase the size of their farm to boost efficiency and to facilitate new entrants into farming. As in other regions, SAFER operates in the Pays de la Loire region as an important mechanism to maintain land in farming.\",\"Taxes levied by SNGs should fall on local residents or non-residents (commuters and visitors) who benefit from the services. Table 3.6 provides guidance on how different revenue tools can be used to finance infrastructure and public services. However, the experience of countries like Brazil suggests that such a move has its risks. Each of the 26 federal states set their own indirect tax rates.\",\"Development will thus be funnelled to areas covered by the existing transport infrastructure or where public transport infrastructure is planned under the mobility master plan. The cost to the city of making land available for public infrastructure, such as roads, public transport, parks and facilities for energy, water, wastewater and solid waste treatment, w'ould be prohibitive as urbanisation advances. One option would be to create a supplementary plan under the current city master plan that identifies the land necessary for public services and could specify measures explaining how to acquire this land or make it available on a timeline. The city could also require private developers to provide land for public services or pay fees at the time of development.\",\"Urban sprawl, pollution, deficient delivery public services (utilities), housing gaps and weak intra-city connectivity are all problems that derive from the lack of appropriate land-use planning and the implementation of regulation. The most urgent need is for urban policy packages promoting efficient use of land for proper allocation of real estate development, as well as the provision of efficient public transport (Ryser and Franchini, 2015). The misallocation of land resources is leading to a shortage of land for sustainable development of a city and its adjacent neighbourhoods. The main local-level actors responsible are direct representatives of the central government.\",\"In 2005, the metropolitan area of Concepcion inaugurated the BIO Train service, providing a 48-kilometre link between the city of Concepcion and the municipalities of Talcahuano, San Pedro de la Paz, Chiguayante and Hualqui (www.biotren.cl\\u002fBiotrenEmpresa.aspx accessed 30 October 2012). In addition, a new fleet of buses with more capacity and better conditions for passengers (taxibuses) was established in 2011, and a new service of night buses was established in June 2012. Public authorities have been resolving the chief problems identified in the design and operation of this system.\",\"Different measures have been implemented to resolve this, including an infrastructure upgrade, an increase in the number of trains, better organisation and distribution of service, more frequent running times and public information campaigns. Despite these efforts, Santiago’s Metro continues to face severe congestion at peak hours (see El Mercurio newspaper, 24 June, 2012). In 2007, this jumped to 600 million (with no increase in the number of Metro lines).\",\"This intersection carries large flows of bus, pedestrian, and motor traffic. The Ring Road, which is a major arterial road, and Aurobindo Marg forms the AIIMS grade-separated interchange.

As the results of EDA investments often materialise over a number of years, the administration projects and reports on indicators that track outcomes three, six and nine years after programme investments have been made. However, these and other data produced for the GPRA have limited use for short- to medium-term decision making.\",\"However, their implementation highlights an important shift from a policy focused on road management to one centred on multimodal access for the population. Several new instruments and institutions have yet to be created for some of the legal changes introduced recently. This section provides an overview of these instruments and institutions and their importance to different areas of mobility policy. The following section addresses the challenges that some of them face, while the section after it provides recommendations on how they can be developed effectively.\",\"This involves calls for tender for the construction of the work, hiring contractors and supervising the execution of the project or projects. Finally, the closing of the neighbourhood contract with the neighbourhood development council includes an evaluation of the programme, recording the experiences of the participants of the project, drawing up an agenda for the future, the alignment of the community’s commitments with the facilities’ operation and maintenance needs, and the formulation of new multi-sector projects. At a “closing event”, the neighbourhood history compiled by the project is presented to the community to promote the continuity of the social and community dynamics initiated by the project and to strengthen the community organisations formed by the programme.

However the programme has limited resources (about USD 1 million per neighbourhood).\",\"In contrast to international good practice, the NAICM project has not only been granted authorisation without a solid and publicly available sustainable ground transport access plan, but has initiated construction bids without this planning instrument. This has raised justified public concerns about the impact of the project on congestion, air quality and accessibility. The Ministiy' of Agrarian, Territorial and Urban Development (SEDATU), the national agency in charge of urban transport policy, hired experts to address surface transport access.\",\"This variation is shown in various studies’-4. Demand for high quality transport service (such as e.g. express commuter buses or frequent rail transit, with public transport-oriented development) tends to increase with income until a medium to medium-high income is reached. Moreover, the demand for a high quality public transport service is potentially much greater in total than for a basic service. Furthermore, even if, as suggested in other studies', changes in income affect public transport demand either directly (positive impact) or indirectly through increased car ownership (negative impact), the indirect impact may be negligible for urban public transport. This is because car owners may still choose to use public transport for urban mobi lity instead of the car, or use both.\",\"For example, UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Initiative has over 450 cities with 72 urban- indicator data points available, and this has been complemented by other global data from 200 cities from the Global Sample of Cities. This helps city mangers to assess the urban policy implications at the national or regional levels that goes beyond the silo assessments of the single urban indicators. For example, slum data has now been expanded and new components of informality and inadequate housing are now available. Additionally, aggregate data shows that people who live in slums are also deprived of many other urban services such as access to adequate health care, reliable transport, safe public spaces, and that these residents live in more hazardous environments where municipal solid waste collection services are unavailable.\",\"In 2015, the consultancy Incentive supported by Dansk Bygningsarv A\\u002fS presented the results of a study commissioned by Realdania (www.realdania.dk) - a large non-profit organization focusing its financial assets on preservation of the built heritage and development of local communities in Denmark. The study clearly demonstrated that listed buildings - apart from the obvious values to their inhabitants and people living nearby or visiting the neighborhoods - also bring a considerable added-value to the housing market. For instance, single-family houses classified as preservation-worthy were on average sold for an 18% higher price per square meter. The added-value was even higher-30% - if only houses with the highest preservation values were included in the comparison. It was clearly demonstrated that a majority of tourists visited the town due to its cultural or built heritage, and that the economic impact of the visitors was considerable in term of job creation.\",\"These data discrepancies are important to understand since, in the absence of fully comparable data (especially as regards travel distances), the report estimates traffic impacts on the basis of other data sources, including aggregate travel distance data gathered from ride service odometer data. In 2015 and 2016, they have been the leading source of growth in non-auto (i.e. non-personal car) travel in the city. They have also added significantly to vehicular travel and mileage on city streets.\",\"Decentralisation could help SNGs assume control over the resources they administer and become more accountable to citizens. This needs to be a flexible process that allows the central\\u002flocal dynamics to evolve. However, a clear plan for its implementation should be designed, with defined roles for the various management levels and linkages between them. Introducing co-ordination mechanisms among cities could facilitate joint investments and enhance metropolitan planning.\",\"The need to attract investment is without question. However, it is unclear how these plans will benefit the urban population living in informal settlements, below the poverty line and with minimal accessto urban services (Watson, 2014). In general, the countries with the highest GDP per capita are those with the largest proportion of their population living in cities (Satterth-waite and Mitlin, 2014, Figure 11.3). In low and middle-income countries, rapid urbanization is generally associated with rapid economic growth (IPCC, 2014).\",\"For example, in India a large gap exists between the price of diesel and gasoline due to fuel subsidies on diesel. This has lead to substantial increases in the sale and production of diesel vehicles, which now make up to 40 per cent of the Indian vehicle market. Initiatives can include the development of electric vehicle infrastructure (see Box 4.9), or the conversion of transport fleets to cleaner fuels (see Box 4.10).\",\"What is an effective and efficient urban transport system? It is one that can satisfy the numerous and diverse requirements of the metropolitan mobility, including minimizing travelling time between various locations, while at the same time internalises externalities to positively affect the well-being and the quality of life of the citizens of that area. This requires that the appropriate authorities transform the available land and financial resources, both limited capital inputs, into relevant transport infrastructure and networks to provide, what is considered, the right combination between the various motorized individual or collective\\u002fpublic and non-motorized transport modes, as well as easy transfers between them to meet the mobility demand (figure 1.1.).\",\"Latest data shows that the expansion of the world's cities has been accompanied by changes in land use, both in terms of form as well as structure, and a progressive reduction of the proportion of space allocated to streets. The integration of public space in local, regional and national policies and frameworks promoting sustainability is key to securing the provision of public space and creating more liveable cities. Ensuring citywide distribution of public spaces is a way for governments to reduce inequalities and expand benefits and prosperity.\",\"The service can be booked by telephone, fax, post and email. This service is not free of charge (EUR 20\\u002fhour for older people), but half of the cost can be deducted from annual income tax. Persons who are accompanying older people are also required to show them how to travel safely, to guide them in the city and to explain the basics of public transport and networks.\",\"Des travaux supplementaires sont necessaires pour comprendre comment les pouvoirs publics peuvent accroitre de maniere efficace Foffre de logements locatifs abordables par le secteur prive.

Continuing on this path will propagate the cycle of extended commuting, high transport costs and levels of congestion, and poor quality of urban life. It is in direct contrast with the principles of TOD.\",\"Negative effects on economic efficiency are mitigated by almost half when a governance body at the metropolitan level exists. In Mexico and in Morelos, funding for metropolitan areas is channelled from the federal government through this fund and is part of the national budget devoted to subsidising state and municipal action on urban development. The operational rules for the Metropolitan Fund require the creation of a Metropolitan Development Council (Cornejo para el Desarrollo Metropolitano, CDM) in order to receive funds (OECD, 2015b).\",\"All Korean rural regions fall in the category predominantly rural close to a city (i.e., there are no rural remote regions in Korea). Korea has 22 functional urban areas covering 26% of the national territory. Out of the 22 FUAs, five are classified as large metropolitan areas (with a population of 1 500 000 or more), and six as metropolitan areas (with a population of 500 000 to 1 500 000), eight as medium-sized urban areas (population between 250 000 to 500 000 people) and three as small urban areas (population between 50 000 and 200 000 people). This definition overcomes previous limitations for international comparability linked to administrative boundaries. This methodology is a clear example of how geographic\\u002fmorphological information from geographic sources and census data can be used together to get a better understanding of how urbanisation develops. These clusters are made of contiguous 1 km2 grid cells with a population density of at least 1 500 inhabitants per km2 and a total population of at least 50 000 people.\",\"Many of the region’s motor vehicles are used in cities, with increasing use accompanying urban population growth. Including both two- and four- wheeled motor vehicles, there are 10.7 million registered vehicles in Delhi, 9.7 million registered vehicles in Bangkok and 5.4 million registered vehicles in Chennai. Around the world, rising incomes are associated with increasing ownership of motor vehicles.\",\"Nevertheless, additional efforts are required, particularly concerning the collation\\u002fanalysis of spatial data (in Spatial Data Infrastructures), the strengthening of national capacities, the identification of network bottlenecks and missing links4', as well as assessments of the criticality, sensitivity and resilience of indispensable components of the transport system (e.g. bridges and tunnels), and the sharing of experiences and 'best practices'(e.g. As shown by the distribution of LPI (Figure 3.14), certain improvements are necessary in many regions.

Given the emphasis on regional sustainable mobility, the restored COMETRAVI or the CAMe could provide one framework for this. While no formal public consultation process has been established, a Citizen Observatory has been created by three non-govemmental organisations.72 The initiative has synthesised public concerns about the project and generated a forum for discussions between experts in relevant domains (including mobility) and other members of civil society7. Formal mechanisms for including this and other input from stakeholders and the general population in the transport plan are essential.\",\"Furthermore, the reported information should be used strategically for policy making.

Communes are governed by a directly elected city council that is chaired by a mayor. The mayor is both the chief executive of the commune and also an agent of the central government, with respect to certain pow'ers (e.g. civil registry, elections organisation).\",\"In some cases, they need to be updated by the time they are approved. National and local examining authorities assess the general plan only in terms of its compliance with the technical norms, rather than with local needs. Once the urban design project is approved, it can be used to supervise urban development.\",\"The OECD Metropolitan Governance Survey has found that the share of residents who are satisfied with the public transport provision in their cities is 14 percentage points higher if a transport authority exists (Figure 2.2). It appears likely that this is at least partly due to the better integration of public transport in these cities. For example, a metropolitan transport authority could be autonomous exclusively in charge of transport issue, or part of a metropolitan authority in charge of w ider policy issues at the metropolitan level.\",\"The centre of the country (Minsk Oblast) is the most urbanized part, while the western part (Brest and Grodno oblasts) has the lowest urbanization (69 and 73 per cent, respectively). Grodno Oblast has the lowest share in total urban population (10.6 per cent). Mogilev, Brest and Vitebsk oblasts have almost equal shares in the oblast structure of the country’s urban settlements (12-13 percent).\",\"This can ease communication across levels and facilitate common accessibility-oriented policy frameworks. To this end, it recognises the need to considerably decrease anthropogenic GHG emissions in a way that is complementary with the social sustainability goal, such as reduction of poverty. However, without ensuring access via alternative modes, these policies can generate negative social externalities, imposing burdens on vulnerable users while not significantly delivering greenhouse gas reductions.\",\"These steps, however, might be significantly different in different regions. Without a successful green technology transition, GHG emissions may increase substantially in the next decades. An obvious way to decrease the transport carbon footprint is to increase the price of energy through taxation, thereby encouraging road users to adopt more energy-efficient driving behaviour and\\u002for to consider other transport modes. However, high fuel taxation can have important implications on mobility, if not complemented by measures promoting viable alternative transport options such as adequate public transport.\",\"Simultaneously, Singapore's Land Transport Authority will call tenders to purchase 50 hybrid buses and 60 electric buses. In India, for example, in 2015 the central Government launched the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) scheme, under which incentives are offered for purchases of electric and hybrid vehicles. The Government is also offering a 4 per cent tax exemption on each vehicle in order to reduce air pollution.\",\"It is also recommended for MPI to establish a knowledge sharing platform where provinces can share their PPGAP experience (e.g., methodology, development processes) with other provinces, so that they can efficiently develop their PGGAPs with less external resources. A central support team could be organised with the involvement of relevant ministries (for example, the Ministry of Construction for urban green growth) which provides training as well as some hands-on support to develop PGGAPs. The central support team, together with the knowledge sharing platform, can ensure effective knowledge exchange and capacity building at the provincial level.\",\"In this respect, no formal procedure for collecting periodical financial data from operators has been instituted. The framework does not include periodical adjustments that respond to cost increases, and there is no clear procedure for determining what affordable tariffs are. Just as in the case of the microbus framework, rigid and discretionary fares can impose major restrictions on guaranteeing high-quality services. Furthermore, without a transparent fare calculation and adjustment formula, the framework continues to fail to offer certainty for operators on their ability to recover investments or have future cost increases reflected in their revenues.\",\"In Viet Nam, it is estimated that 68% of the labour force generates their income from the informal economy, which does not allow them to access traditional financing sources (World Bank, 2015a). This system was intended as an instrument of security, economic planning and migration control, as movement had to be permitted by local authorities. Moreover, permanent residence was attached to the provision of rationing, land, housing, education, health services and employment, thus strongly restricting internal migration. Migrants no longer required a departure permit from their local authority or the provision of a proof of employment or university enrolment to move to another city, and a tempo ran,' registration status was introduced.\",\"Given the limited capacity of cities, especially the smallest ones that lack the capacity to develop complex studies, support on how to develop cost-benefits analyses would enable cities to do more. Supporting local policies with national and international ones is essential. It is crucial not only to focus on measures in affluent countries but also measures that can be implemented in low(er) incomes countries.\",\"The 2008 strategy is judged to have failed mainly due to problems with its design, and for providing insufficient evidence for the benefits that the significant institutional changes in water management could bring (OECD, 2011b). Other OECD countries have successfully established river basin organisations and pursued watershed management, while recognising the challenge of managing the multiple actors and interests involved in such co-ordination efforts (see Box 2.18). Examples of river basin organisations can be found in Australia (Murray-Darling Basin Authority), France (6 Agences de l’Eau), Mexico (25 organismos de cuenca), Portugal (5 Administragoes de Regiao Hidrogra\\u002fica), the Netherlands (Water Boards) and Spain (9 confederadones hidrograficas).\",\"Buses are tracked in real time and provide information beyond the simple traffic flow. The system recognises whether a bus stops, accelerates rapidly or opens its doors, allowing monitoring of driver behaviour. The collected information on traffic flow's is made available to the public via smart phone apps and information boards at bus stations, which include the precise arrival time of the next buses, current traffic conditions and details on arrival of metros at neaiby subway stops.\",\"The same characteristics that make cities socially and economically progressive spaces also generate complex environmental and social challenges that can only be met by active public interventions at multiple scales, at the household (e.g. housing subsidies), city (e.g. planning) and national levels (e.g. trade and employment policies). If these challenges arc not dealt with effectively, the welfare of individuals, communities and entire nations can suffer. These are no inevitable consequences of rapid urban population growth, rather, they are a consequence of political and institutional failure that inhibits effective urban planning, policymaking, investment and regulation.\",\"Efforts to collect this data at a city level are underway in countries to ensure its availability in the coming monitoring rounds for this goal. This target has two indicators, data and methodology, both of which are available. Weak land-use planning, informal settlements often located on high-risk areas and limited disaster response capacities in African cities exacerbate disaster vulnerability.\",\"There are now 11 transport card companies (including KSCC), operating in different cities and provinces through direct service contracts with subnational authorities. Beyond these conventional pre-paid sendees, ten commercial banks nationwide also topped their own credit or debit cards with a public transport card function, with deferred payment. Transfer discounts are applicable for up to 4 times a day, within a transfer time limit of 30 minutes (up to 1 hour from 9 pm to 7 am the next day).

This not only takes account of the number of inhabitants, but also corrects for differences in tax-eaming capacity (real estate value of dwellings and business property) and external circumstances, like a regional function or the social and physical structure. This includes indicators for the number of households receiving social benefits, the number of people from ethnic minority groups, the number of young or elderly, the density of addresses and the surface area of the historical centre. However, differences in other revenues, like interest, dividend or from the sale of land, are not taken into account.\",\"Kubler suggests that in the case of Sydney there was an evolution over multiple decades from a bargaining approach that focused on achieving specific outcomes to one that is more like problem solving and is oriented to finding a process to manage land-use conflicts. Ways to better manage interconnections between urban areas and their more rural hinterlands were explored in the 2013 report OECD Rural Policy Reviews: Rural-Urban Partnerships. Prague was one of the 11 case study regions. The main conclusion of the report is that rural and urban places within metropolitan regions are strongly coupled across multiple dimensions, including: population and commuting flows, investments and economic transactions, service provision, environmental goods and amenities, and government interactions (Figure 4.2).\",\"For Japan, this means that an increase of 3 000 steps a day per person could lower the country’s annual medical bill by 5.5%, substantially reducing the incidence of diabetes, stroke and heart attacks. Toyama’s compact city strategies aim to encourage citizens to walk and thereby improve public health. Yokohama’s FutureCity strategy introduces a new type of urban structure to support local communities by improving their connectivity.\",\"Revenue from a dedicated transport tax (versement transport) levied on employers and based on payrolls has enabled the STIF to extend and maintain the public transport network and non-motorised transport facilities. The city’s success results from close co-operation between its Urban Transport Planning Authority (URBS), responsible for transport, and the urban development authority' (IPUCC), which is in charge of land-use planning.

Any analysis using FUAs will thus clearly mention it.\",\"Sprawling cities shift fringe areas towards new land uses (including residential, industrial and business areas) and away from their traditional social and economic functions (Seret et al, 2014). Land use planners need to balance diverse interests in such areas, such as the need to protect open green space and natural amenities, to protect agricultural lands, to provide critical infrastructure and transportation for growing urban areas and to meet housing demand. The push and pull between these various uses is inherently tied to questions of how this space should be governed and how' to define the public interest in questions about how’ land should be used and developed (or not, as the case may be).\",\"Although UNODC shows a general decline in victimization related crimes (rape, robbery and burglary) across the world between 1995-2009, respondents in African countries experienced higher victimization rates than respondents in a sample of developed countries. A 2014 survey conducted by European Union Fundamental Rights Agency (AFR, 2014) suggested that more than half of women in the EU have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime and every fifth woman has been sexually harassed in the preceding 12 months. More than half of women in EU have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime. In Africa, burglary is the most prevalent form of crime followed by assault.\",\"The MCDCB has been successful in developing and expressing a strong and coherent regional vision, synthesised in the JICA Mega Cebu Roadmap study, and as such has set the stage as a strong advocate to the national government in terms of capital funding, policy implementation, and LGU capacity building.

In general, the receiving area allow s for higher density of construction than the base density established by law through density bonuses provided by local governments, thereby creating incentives for developers to buy the development rights (Tavares, 2003). Successful TDR programmes require strict sending-area regulations, market incentives and or ways for development to gain bonus density' without using TDR (Pruetz and Standridge, 2005).\",\"There has been a 16 per cent reduction in the amount of wastewater discharged into water bodies over this period. The bulk of wastewater discharge (about 70 per cent) constitutes effluent treated to standard quality. The share of wastewater discharged without treatment in the period 2005-2013 has varied between 0.4 and 1 per cent of overall discharged wastewater. A substantial share of wastewater discharge containing pollutants (about 69 per cent) comes from local sources (i.e. settlements and settlement-based industries).\",\"While policy instruments need to be tailored to local conditions, calling for targeted action in specific sectors that can be particularly relevant in some cities, a number of overarching insights also merits consideration and will be briefly discussed below. Previous chapters have laid out innovative, internationally comparable data that help grasp how inclusively cities are growing. While the OECD is working on expanding such data, governments can also adapt them locally and develop their own indicators of well-being and progress.\",\"Some researchers even aigue that Cebu could pursue an alternative development strategy through sustainable ecotourism, instead of urban development through reclamation (Montenegro, 2016). In addressing such environmental concerns, the potential impacts of reclamation projects on the coastal eco-systems of Cebu and Central Visayas as a whole should be taken into account when making development decisions. In addition, its social impacts should be carefully assessed. In Barcelona, Spain, the Moll de Fusta is a platform that was designed on the waterfront and extended to the seafront in between the districts of Barceloneta and the southern foothills of Montjuic.\",\"Through a collaborative effort among Ghananian-based professionals, local community members and international experts, the initiative developed strategies to convert a two-acre plot of land into an urban green space. Not only do roads ensure population mobility, they foster the local economy and prosperity in general. Between 30 and 35 per cent of a city's land area should be reserved for this essential urban backbone, in order to prioritise active and public transport.2 With limited to no streets, slums are socially and economically weak and disconnected from the rest of urban areas. In planned city areas, the street space may be unequally distributed or designed in favour of active and public transportation, the modes of mobility children and their families depend on.\",\"The Tutubi bike sharing scheme was the first in the Philippines to be launched in Pasig City (Clean Air Asia, 2013). It was a demonstration project supported by the Asian Development Bank intended to demonstrate the feasibility of green transport. Due to the success of the project, plans are underway to expand the system to other cities and set up 250 stations with approximately 22 500 bicycles. Subsequent phases of the project are planned to target Metro Manila.\",\"Old trams and trolleybus lines are progressively disconnected because of the poor service and high operation and maintenance costs. In most cities, public transport relies on buses, and the light-rail transit (LRT) networks suffer from serious lack of rationalisation. Delegation of communal services to the private sector will work only if the national government helps city governments modernise communal infrastructure. However, city akimats need to be more pro-active in finding ways to refurbish urban infrastructure.\",\"Some flexibility over pay may help adapt pay levels to the market situation in each city. This will result in pay differentials across different governments and cities, but not necessarily across individuals. The experience of OECD countries in this respect is wide and mixed. One issue for consideration is affordability, and whether SNGs have the resources to pay competitive salaries.\",\"For example, Terres de liens, a national association whose activity is directed towards the protection and the renewal of land devoted to farming in per-urban districts. These initiatives are connected to others in the area, such as the recently launched policy by the Conseil Departemental to promote local food in school canteens and thus support local growers. There are many potential benefits from improved urban-rural co-operation.\",\"Required replacements and an expansion of the existing network require significant investment, which is not covered in the operating budget of the utilities providers. This is seldom the case across the OECD. Among the three revenue sources for utilities providers, taxes, tariffs and transfers, governments decide on the most efficient mix of resources to manage trade-offs between economic efficiency, financial sustainability, environmental protection and social cohesion. This pillar combines two strategies.\",\"Tokyo, Japan, has used a model that combines privatisation of transport service and joint development. Brazil and Colombia have had significant successes with the use of betterment levies, or contribucion de valorizacion (Walters, 2012). London has successfully used a package of value capture mechanisms to raise 25% of the necessary funding for the London Crossrail project (Box 2.11).\",\"It recognizes that funding from all sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, domestic and international, as well as alternative sources will need to be tapped into to effectively exploit the benefits of cities. For example, the African Union (AU), in collaboration with the Economic Commission for Africa and UN-Flabitat, is developing a regional framework aligned with Africa Agenda 2063, the SDGs, the Paris Agreement among others. In Europe, the 2016 regional urban agenda2 has been further aligned with the global urban agendas through action plans and linked directly with the urban related SDGs targets.\",\"In both dense and low-dense urban settings, there is a growing lack of the human scale of the neighbourhood. Walkability in cities has decreased enormously due to car-oriented transportation policies and street design. The following highlight what urban planning sh in the first place (step 1). In such a scenario, large, private economic sectors - an exclusive partner privileged to create and implement policies - tend to influence urban planning.\",\"Transport policies that aim to affect behaviour, e.g. by altering travel routes, distance, modes, frequency, or schedules, can accomplish this through either \\\"push\\\" or \\\"pull\\\" measures. Although they do not have to be monetary in nature, most often these measures come in the form of pricing measures, involving either costs for non-compliance (push) or monetary rewards for compliance (pull). The potential for such measures to have unintended behavioural effects (e.g. rebound effects), however, should also be recognised and addressed.\",\"The opinions expressed and arguments employed herein do not necessarily reflect the official views of ITF or OECD member countries. The work for this report was carried out in the context of the Decarbonising Transport Initiative of the International Transport Forum. The author thanks the participants of the ITF Decarbonising Passenger Transport Workshop, as well as Wei-Shiuen NG, Jari Kauppila, and Michael Kloth for their comments.\",\"At the national level, responsibilities are shared between the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), Local Water Utilities Association (LWUA), the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), without any official co-ordinating body. In the case of flood management, the absence of NEDA in committee meetings of the Environment Management Bureau, despite the obvious role this Authority could play, reveals the gaps existing in national policy frameworks. At the local level, the allocation of responsibilities between water districts and LGUs is sometimes unclear and not efficient, and there is no appointed body for disaster risk reduction in LGUs, creating a lot of inconsistencies across jurisdictions about the management of this issue.\",\"The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts to understand and to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate governance, the information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies. The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.\",\"In the latter, the mayor took a progressive stance to locate high quality transport and cultural amenities in the poorest neighbourhoods. Consequently, new urban policies are needed to harness the benefits that arise from different groups of people living in close proximity to one another, rather than letting these heterogeneous urban conditions combust into intolerance, xenophobia and widening inequalities. In other words, the heterogeneity, density and diversity of cities, which is what makes them nodes of economic innovation and democratic progress, must be managed and planned, short of which these very variables that make successful cities can transform them into places of social exclusion and inequality.\",\"Urban Toronto in Canada, the University of Chicago Urban Network in the United States, and the Viet Nam Urban Forum (VUF) are examples of platforms for networking and discussion on key urban issues among agents from different backgrounds. The membership of the VUF, for instance, chaired by the Ministry' of Construction, includes public, private and nonprofit organisations (universities, think tanks and so on) and even international organisations. The VUF, a platform for discussion on urban issues, regularly review's and reports to stakeholders on the state of ongoing urban development programmes. It also contributes to a deeper understanding of urban upgrading projects.\",\"Efficient transport and mobility systems are at the core of poverty and exclusion policies. Connectivity is crucial for prosperity and development to occur, and for integrating people to places, opportunities, markets and jobs. Data shows that the world's demand for public transport has increased by nearly one fifth.\",\"Stronger rural-urban linkages are helping the rural supply chain meet the demand of urban areas. Evidence abounds of farmers who have increased their production when connected to growing urban and regional markets (Reardon et al., This is the case of farmers growing teff in Ethiopia, vegetables in Mali or Senegal, or potatoes in Rwanda or of dairy farmers in Kenya. They have invested in soil conservation, added organic matter into their soils, used productivity-enhancing seeds, breeds and fertiliser, as well as irrigation and machines.\",\"These strategies should be viewed as complements to the suggested reforms to the housing finance system. Generally speaking, this can be achieved by encouraging within-city development activity and\\u002for discouraging construction outside the existing city limits. To that end, policy makers could make infill and redevelopment cheaper by reducing regulations and streamlining permits and other administrative procedures.\",\"Prior to zoning revisions required by state planning laws adopted in 1973 (Comprehensive Land Use Planning Co-ordination Act, Oregon) and 1990 (Growth Management Act, Washington), residential zoning in the suburbs set large minimum sizes for new subdivisions. As late as 1978, the average minimum size for a new residential subdivision lot in the Metro urban growth boundary (outside the downtown Portland area) was 13 000 ft2 (Ketcham et al., A number of suburban cities in the region prohibited apartments. Instead of requiring a connected system of streets in new subdivisions, cities allowed developers to establish cul-de-sac communities that funnelled auto trips onto state highways. Residential development was haphazard and uncoordinated, led by private developers rather than by public investment.\",\"On the one hand, this could be indicative of low payroll costs because staffing is not sufficient to meet municipal administrative, operational and service delivery requirements, or indicative of low remuneration levels. It could also signal that the municipality is not willing or able to bridge this gap with consultants, a frequent practice in Chile. When evaluating 2011 human resource levels among top-ranking municipalities in the Quality of Life Index,3 Antofagasta had below-average levels of two primary consultant categories - honorario and honorario a programas -and was just above average for total human resource4 levels (Table 4.3). The city may need to further evaluate whether it needs to spend more on human resources by taking on more staff in the honorario categories. One of the marked differences in looking at the employment spread is that with the exception of Vitacura, the high scorers on the Quality of Life Index depend more on consultants. Ultimately, however, the question is not how much is spent on human resources but how it is spent.\",\"The taskforce was in charge of revitalising the city through thinking of the city in new ways. Reporting directly to the Brisbane City Council’s City Planning Committee and Lord Mayor Graham Quirk, URB has achieved great success in breathing new life into the city of Brisbane. The 2006 City Centre Master Plan met with tremendous success, leading to an improved 2014 City Centre Master Plan that lias been designed as a co-ordinated strategy to guide the future of Brisbane's development, transport and public space investment over the following 20 years.\",\"This planning tradition became less prevalent after the 1970s, which resulted in considerably less dense outward development in the municipalities outside the central city. While provincial and city land use plans continued to stress compact development and public transit use, the realities in many parts of the Toronto region were urban sprawl and high car use, as a result of the application of many land use instruments, such as zoning by-laws and building codes, that did not support compact, higher-density development.\",\"It recommends a distinct set of actions on the basis of four types of settlements: agglomerations, cities of secondaiy importance (centres of oblasts), small towns and monotow ns. Most of the proposed actions were intended to revise legislation and create better conditions for uiban development. However, they were not fully realised. The RDP w,as extended by including sectorial programs, and the main implementation focus was switched to construction of infrastructure rather than development of institutional conditions.\",\"While it may have a negative effect if road density translates into shorter and more efficient transport, it could also have a positive effect if it induces greater use of private vehicles resulting in more emissions. Consequently, this transport variable could be a proxy of connectivity efficiency or alternatively capture the level of car use. A second proxy for transportation intensity is Road access, an indicator of the connectivity of an urban area.\",\"As a result, it is difficult for authorities to expand service provision to match the pace of urban expansion. In the case of public transport, the difficulty of providing bus services is complicated by development whose roads are unable to accommodate buses. The lack of access to public transport in many areas is further exacerbated by increasing motorcycle dependence. For example, the city should ensure the implementation of its plan to put 220 eco-friendly buses into operation by 2020.\",\"In several UNESCWA countries, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan and United Arab Emirates total foreign trade is larger than GDP, indicating their dependence on engaging in international trade patterns. Inland freight transport tends to involve higher volumes in developed and\\u002for large countries, where the dependence on international trade (which is mostly facilitated by maritime and\\u002for air transport) is lower than that of the smaller and\\u002for land and sea-locked countries. In terms of value (imports and exports), maritime transport has been by far the most important transport mode. In September 2010, freight with a worth of €128 billion was transported by sea, €57 billion by air and €43 billion by road.\",\"Table 3.4 shows that almost 40% of SNGs’ total revenue is self-generated - mainly tax-sharing arrangements - while almost 60% is transfers.9 Across OECD countries, the average is 44% and 38% respectively, in OECD unitary countries, such as Iceland, Sweden and New Zealand, tax revenue as a percentage of local revenue ranges from more than 50% to less than 15% in Estonia, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom, (OECD, 2016c). In 2012, on average, 49% of the transfers granted to SNGs were non-targeted (non-earmarked), 47% were targeted (earmarked) and 4% were loans from upper level governments. However, targeted transfers vary from year to year and from region to region.\",\"This includes an extensive set of performance measures for each of its five goals and component strategies (Metro Vancouver, 2014a). Assessments are also made against the baseline performance report (Metro Vancouver, 2014b). Often found in instances of polycentric urban development, lightly institutionalised platforms for information sharing and consultation are relatively easy both to implement and to undo. They typically lack enforcement tools and their relationship with citizens and other levels of government tends to remain minimal.\",\"The World Bank has recently conducted research on targeted subsidies in cities in Latin America. Among the main conclusions is that developing better subsidy schemes for lower income populations in the region is now possible given the use of smart cards and better methodologies for defining and identifying beneficiaries. In addition to subsidies targeted at lower income and other vulnerable groups, public transport services in the ZMVM should explore differentiated fares for peak and off-peak travel. Besides helping increase revenues, this should also help to reduce crowding at peak hours.\",\"Finally, it can intervene to preserve and stimulate (local, regional, cultural) identities as well as the heritage. The relationships between national and regional or even local policy and regulatory frameworks are evolving. The national level often no longer suffices to determine successful business activities.\",\"In essence, practitioners will have more latitude to make judgements about what type of information is required in order to proceed with a development. The environmental code requires that the state and the provinces adopt an area vision. These measures outline the environmental values or goals to be achieved. For municipalities, this is the regional plan, for the water boards, the Water Regulation, and for the provinces, an area regulation.\",\"Other Russian regions have introduced a separate investment fund for renovating the electricity network. This might also be a possibility for the Agglomeration to tackle the challenge of lacking funds. However, it will not help in addressing the fundamental shortcomings of the system. Streamlining the system and creating incentives for private investments should be complementary measures. For this, it would be necessary to simplify ownership structures, ensure transparency in the distribution system, clearly attribute responsibilities for maintenance, and create a level playing field for private investors beyond concessions. Since 1991, there has been a strong focus on developing road infrastructure, this period has also witnessed the break-up and partial privatisation of the previously monolithic public transport system.\",\"Therefore, the third CNTP (1992-2001) set four targets: regionally decentralised development, efficient land use, improvement of the quality of life, and enhancing amenity and unification of South and North Korea. The intention was to balance regional development by strengthening industrial centres along the west coast and the regional and provincial cities. In order to ensure support for less industrialised areas, the Law on Regional Balanced Development and Promotion of Local Small and Medium-sized Firms was enacted, establishing eight area-wide development plans.\",\"This publication evolved from the Southeast Asian Economic Outlook.

It was included in the OECD’s Southeast Asia Regional Programme (SEARP) at the Steering Group Meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia in March 2015, with its role of providing a horizontal view of activities, identifying emerging trends in the region and providing a backbone for the different streams of the Programme confirmed at the 2015 MCM.\",\"A compendium of joint initiatives put together by Metro Vancouver staff identified over 80 past and current joint projects between Metro Vancouver and UBC. Building upon the success of this relationship, in late 2014, senior staff from UBC and Metro Vancouver met to discuss the respective goals and needs of their organisations, as well as the range of opportunities for further collaboration. Through these discussions the concept of a ‘Strategic Collaboration Memorandum' arose and prompted staff from both organisations to work together on a model tliat would explore and expand upon opportunities for future partnerships. The MOU is a framework document within which the parties will identify and pursue joint initiatives.\",\"Finally, it recommends further steps to improve the high fragmentation and low co-ordination within the sector. The objective is to provide the Government with an indication of the areas in which possible reform endeavour may be launched. The chapter also contributes to building comparative evidence and analysis by the OECD of international experiences and good practices among OECD countries in designing and implementing equivalent reforms. It firmly draws from the 2012 OECD Recommendations on Regulatory Policy and Governance presented in Box 2.1 (OECD, 2012a) and, in particular, Principle 10 which stresses the imperative for policy co-ordination and regulatory coherence.\",\"De nombreuses personnes sont sans abris : les statistiques sont certes difficiles a comparer, mais la plupart des pays de l’OCDE signalent que 1 a 8 personnes sur mille sont privees d’un acces regulier au logement.

In the New York Declaration, Member States condemned acts and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against refugees and migrants.\",\"This is often based on misperceptions -for example one DAC donor in Niger stated that non-DAC donors never made the effort to go to joint donor meetings on development and aid, whereas a non-DAC donor complained that they were not invited to events or kept in the loop about different donor initiatives. There is at times a feeling in donor meetings or fora that whoever mobilises the most funds and has the largest projects, de facto, are a more important actor with a larger say in matters, regardless of how they are spending their budgets, whether their programming is high quality with great impact, or not. Some very large multilaterals also seem to feel that they have everything 'under control' and that they don't need to form partnerships.\",\"These associations have no direct administrative capacity, but exist as voluntary organisations with legal standing with specific powers delegated to the organisation by the controlling communes. Mergers (or amalgamations) of communes are very rare in France, and this institutional mechanism in effect takes their place. They construct their own planning documents (plan local d'urbanisme, PLU or Zone d’Amenagement Concertee “Concerted Planning Area”).\",\"A great deal of its strength comes from the strong support and influence on decision making that it exercises as a result of the non-partisan, highly participative and technical nature of its activities. Antofagasta’s Creo Antofagasta could reproduce these characteristics, since it already enjoys support from a wide variety of actors (private and public) that are willing to contribute knowledge and funds. Furthermore, Creo Antofagasta’s wide support can be a good source of resources beyond those necessary for day-to-day activities, and allow it to emulate the RPA’s funding scheme centred on an independently managed endowment that provides 80% of the funds required for its operations. The rest of the financing would be generated by grants and fees-for-service (Regional Plan Association, n.d.). It transformed into the urban institute for the Ile-de-France Region when the latter took over the functions of the former in 1976, and in 1982 IAU-IdF became an associated body of the Regional Council. Although focused on the territory of the Ile-de-France Region, the IAU-IdF also conducts studies in co-operation with other European metropolises on topics that include economic competitiveness, planning, public transport and airports.\",\"The two following practices are good illustrations of this process. In the city of Gothenburg (Sweden) a detailed working plan was finalised in 2010 and adopted as the regular system, with the goal to encourage more use of public transport and so-called flex-lines and bicycles, and to decrease the use of the expensive -municipality-paid - Special Transport Services (STS)6 and taxis. The project succeeded in that many STS passengers switched to using buses and trams (again). From 2008 to 2009, the number of STS trips decreased by 32 000 (5%) while the journeys with flex-lines increased from 132 000 to 137 000.\",\"As cities have adapted to accommodate greater car use, however, walking has been marginalised as a convenient and enjoyable mode of transportation, exposing pedestrians to environmental risks in the form of accidents and poor air quality. A high level of walkability is defined as involving good public transit connectivity, high residential density, and the presence of many local destinations within walking distance. A critical factor for maintaining walkability in larger cities is accessibility to public transit for longer journeys.\",\"State employees will be assessed through annual individual plans, ministers and ob\\\\ast-akims through specific indicators of quality of public services, quality of life and attracted investment. Government agencies are assessed through the implementation of strategic plans, and members of the government through macroeconomic indicators.

Ownership of motorbikes and scooters is not as strongly associated with wealth as car ownership (Figure 2.7). Even in the Philippines - the country with the greatest gap in motorbike and scooter ownership between the top and bottom household wealth quintiles - only 34.6% of households with these vehicles were among the wealthiest and 7.2% were among the least wealthy. Rural and urban households also show more similar patterns in motorbike and scooter ownership than car ownership by wealth. Wealth indices are calculated using information on household ownership of selected assets, housing construction materials, and access to water and sanitation facilities.\",\"The development of heat supply systems is now based on TCP 45^1.02-204-2010 “Heat Supply Schemes of Settlements.

However, transport outcomes were also defined by the stagnation of mass transit and the deregulation of bus services.11 More recent projects have resumed mass transit expansion and have introduced significant improvements in bus service. The BRT scheme in Mexico City is called Metrobus.\",\"Investment is more likely to be cost effective in cities that are already close to becoming attractive and productive locations for firms and investors, and in cities that can support investments targeted to industries already interested in locating there. Investment in roads and connectivity based on careful spatial vision will in the long run help to evolve viable secondary cities. Policies targeting spatial investments should on this basis consider not just national but regional economic geography. The upshot is that governments should avoid policies that harm or undermine cities and their economic functioning.\",\"The city-region of Amsterdam then changed from a form of mandatory co-operation into the voluntary partnership of 15 municipalities that it is today whose primary function is the provision of regional transportation, excluding rail (Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal, 2012). The group has created a tool (Trans form City) that integrates stoiytelling, data-sharing, co-creation, participatory' democracy, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding. The project aims to engage citizens, businesses, organisations and the government directly in order to exchange information and ideas and collectively plan and change their city or neighbourhood.\",\"Therefore, the policies that emerge must be implementable, universal, sensitive and relevant to the local context. They must be participatory and collaborative. They must be inclusive and recognize the rights of minorities and vulnerable groups. Above all, the policies must be sustainable. This trend is not new, but relentless and has been marked by a remarkable increase in the absolute numbers of urban dwellers—from a yearly average of 57 million between 1990-2000 to 77million between 2010-2015. In 1990,43 per cent (2.3 billion) of the world’s population lived in urban areas, by 2015, this had grown to 54 per cent (4 billion).\",\"The Inner Areas National Strategy was launched in 2014 to cope with service delivery and development issues in such areas. The whole process for the local development projects is a bottom up approach that relies heavily on the active participation of local actors, while combining a top-down approach in for example the selection of areas and offering guidance. After a long process of analysis, negotiation and debate among local and national stakeholders, the Programme Framework Agreement (Accordo di Programma Quadro) is materialised as a contract among the municipal association, regional and central governments.\",\"In 2013, there were 342 MPOs in the United States. The US Congress created MPOs in the 1960s as flexible entities that adapt to local conditions in order to best allocate federal transport funding. In order to obtain federal funding, MPOs are required to periodically develop long-range transportation plans (also referred to as regional transportation plans or RTPs), with planning horizons of at least 20 years.\",\"Korea has also introduced various regulatory policy instruments, including reinforced building codes, mandatory estimation of energy consumption and the submission of an energy savings plan when applying for a building permit. The government has also introduced the Eco-Friendly Building Certificate and Energy Efficiency Grading instruments to provide the housing market with information about energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in determining how to efficiently regulate energy consumption in residences.\",\"As illustrated in the example of Frankfurt, the creation of such metropolitan transport authorities has facilitated fare integration and expansion of the public transport supply, which can support more inclusive economic development (Box 5.9). A few authorities also enjoy competencies in terms of public parking and sometimes urban spatial planning, which can help guide an integrated urban development strategy and promote inclusive growth throughout the entire metropolitan area. The widely documented experience of Bogota and Seoul in conducting extensive reforms of their public transport systems suggests that urban transport systems can help reconcile economic, social and environmental objectives (Box 5.10).\",\"The percentage exceeds 90% in cities in other Latin American countries (see World Bank, 2013). Programmes for the expansion of meters have been implemented. Between 2007 and 2012, SACMEX increased the number of working meters from less than 600 000 to 1 253 626, but a significant shortfall remains, of about 25% of users, who mostly pay a fixed consumption fee.31 A further advantage of having a meter installed is that awareness of actual consumption is raised. This can create a measurable impact on water demand by itself (Grafton et al.,\",\"In absolute terms, the population decline in predominantly rural regions was 97 669 people in the period of 2000-17. These population dynamics across different types of regions in Korea are in line with OECD trends (Figure 1.3). In almost all OECD countries, regions with predominantly rural population have seen a decrease in population in the aforementioned period (OECD, 2018p]). However, Korea’s predominantly rural regions are amongst the rural regions that have experienced the most dramatically decreases. According to the evidence, two out of five regions experienced population growth in the period of 2000-2017.\",\"The ecological land management programme (POEREM) although mainly focused on land use it introduces environmental criteria that should be taken into account by the state and local administration when they decide the different uses of land. The state administration is also promoting a programme for climate action in municipalities (Programas de Accion Climatica Municipal, PACMUNE), with the aim of improving the knowledge of local actors about the environmental issues in their territory. There is however a lack of an overarching strategy for environmental conservation in Morelos. For instance, issues related to w'aste management, GHG emissions, and land use are addressed in different programmes.\",\"Moreover, considering the importance of the public transport system for the low-income segment in Chile, price comparisons should consider that minimum salaries are considerably higher in France and in Spain than in Chile. Prices do not include the use of the metro in suburbs or outside the main city areas of Madrid or Paris. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive urban planning system that promotes policy coherence and synergies between transport and related development policies is essential.\",\"According to Makhmutova (2012), many internal migrants with children had to resort to questionable measures, including bribing the kindergarten administration or buying registration certificates, to obtain kindergarten places. Tukmadieva (2015) found out that in Astana, 22% of internal migrants surveyed had paid for registration (illegally) in 2014. The most common reasons for doing so include enrolling children at school or in kindergarten, accessing medical services and renewing passports or other ID documents.\",\"The chapter starts by describing the current strategic framework for regional and urban development strategies and key policy documents in national administration. It also investigates the gaps between the framework in place and urban development needs, the potential role and objectives of a national urban policy, as well as sectoral reforms that can address urban areas’ main challenges. In particular, the chapter highlights urban policies that can enhance competitiveness while addressing inequality, increase the availability of affordable housing, and improve land-use planning. National government support for housing production by non-governmental organisations has been greatly reduced.\",\"In so doing, public authorities and private operators will need to account for the growing diversity of options that can be mobilised to improve mobility and access outcomes. In this context, perhaps a more relevant conceptual lens for this century's urban transport systems is between transport using one's own vehicle and transport provided by personalised or shared services. Capturing the diversity of innovative mobility services is not straightforward since business models are constantly evolving and new services are continually being trialled - even within individual companies.\",\"Those rural areas, which averaged more than 51 inhabitants per kmJ, accounted for 58% of the total rural population.

These principles cover a much broader set of data than released by Uber through its Movement platform and, for instance, while it may be analogous to some of the data that taxis may have to provide in New York City, it represents a broad expansion of data requests in relation to ride services. This, NACTO states, is necessary in order to enable cities to better carry out data-driven planning and policy decisions, and to help them redesign streets to meet modern needs.\",\"Responsibility for balancing urban and green areas at the regional level is left to the provincial authorities. To this end, the central government has abolished the national landscape policy and reduced the number of nature management regimes.

To take this process forward, UN-Habitat's Action Framework for Implementation of the New Urban Agenda has identified National Urban Policy as the first pillar for this implementation. This is the first ever report to monitor and evaluate National Urban Policies at the global scale, covering 150 countries across all continents, building on shared methodologies and processes across our two Organisations.\",\"This is precipitated by lack of any substantial land value capture mechanisms in urban development, meaning that the revenue local governments are receiving is significantly less than w'hat it could and should be. This is in strong contrast with other government revenues which are collected by the central government and redistributed. In the absence of a consistently enforced land policy framework, the selling off of periphery land proceeds independently of either rational development principles or an accurate reckoning of consequences immediate or long-term.\",\"The Singaporean experience can be extended to other contexts for planning retail developments and other public facilities to maximise both user access to and use of the developments (e.g. number of visits to retail centres). The assessment recommended prioritising investment on 17 km of paths within the areas around essential metro stations. The investment proposal took into account improvements that would reduce access barriers for the people who mostly used the amenities, particularly vulnerable groups such as women and children.\",\"Specifically, Goal 11 recognizes the role cities play in climate change through several targets including Targets 11.2,11.5,11.b, 11.C. Latest data indicates that cities are major contributors to climate change as they account for between 60 and 80% of energy consumption and generate more than 70% of all greenhouse gases emissions, waste and air pollution but they are also highly vulnerable to natural disasters. The NDCs place an emphasis on climate actions that are mainly connected to urban planning, transportation and early-warning systems. In general, urbanization features in about 70% of the submitted NDCs (113 out of 164), demonstrating the linkages between urbanization and climate change actions.”' The strong connection between NDCs and SDG 11 is crucial for achieving the 2030 Agenda and the success of the Paris agreement, making the two initiatives inter-dependent.\",\"They further apply different schedules, according to some measure of need within the neighbourhood. In the Federal District, for example, need is assessed based on a block-level development index that combines data on social marginalisation, income and property values. Comparability across tariffs is further limited by the inclusion or exclusion of fixed fees and drainage. Despite the challenge in creating comparable indices, studies tend to find that the price for water in the Federal District is very low by comparison with the municipalities across the metropolitan area.\",\"The regional context statement is adopted as part of the OCP by the municipality and must be submitted to the regional district Board of Directors for acceptance. There is a dispute resolution process prescribed if the two parties are unable to agree. The regional context statement must be submitted to the regional district within two years of a new regional growth strategy being adopted, and must be renewed every five years.\",\"Typically combined with density bonuses. Can in principle be used to encourage any type of use. Evidence that this reduces the rate of new developments in a territory. In Amsterdam, the large number of commuters from surrounding areas to the city has led to traffic congestion and its attendant impacts such as air pollution.\",\"Furthermore, regular engagements with associations of MSMEs would be necessary to better develop mechanisms for adoption of less polluting and environmentally friendly approaches in their work since such technologies and approached keep evolving. This could help mobilise the needed support to ensure Cebu in all its spheres remain on an environmentally sustainable path. Greening industries is not only beneficial to residents but for the business as well, since cost reductions increases the economic returns to the business whilst at the same time conserves the environment to mitigate effects of climate change.\",\"In these cases, it is the Chairman of the intercommunal body who will have primary responsibility for planning decisions (French Property, 2016). Expropriations for private uses of land are not possible. Reasons for expropriations include the construction of infrastructure, public buildings, and housing developments as well as the establishment of nature reserves.\",\"In order to promote systematic development of transit centres, the Multi-Modal Transit Center Development Master Plan is established every five years. The plan incorporates development strategies of multi-modal transit centres at national, regional and local levels. Efforts for wider adoption of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In the past, the ITS were largely confined to road and car traffic management, and thus opportunities to improve inter-sectoral synergies through these technologies have been lost. The ITS Master Plan lays the groundwork for sectoral ITS plans as w'ell as local ITS plans, which altogether aim to facilitate all-inclusive smart traffic management. Through a five-year national plan, efforts to develop advanced traffic technologies will be made at the national level.\",\"It has been supporting the development of a BRT corridor which opened in December 2012 and now carries more than 280,000 persons per day. Lessons from Lanzhou are being used to develop BRT systems in other Asian cities including Astana, Davao, Dhaka, Jinagxi Ji'ar and Yichang. Finally, EBRD financed an important BRT project in Burgas, Bulgaria, as a complement to EU financing.\",\"Access to safe public spaces greatly informs the perceived and real sentiment of urban safety, which is itself a key prerequisite for protection against physical and sexual harassment. These safety measures in return determine the level of accessibility and inclusivity in use of public spaces, particularly for the vulnerable urban populations (including women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities). Indicator 11.7.2 aims to measure the proportion of persons who have experienced physical or sexual harassment with various forms of disaggregation.\",\"Permanent political committees and administrative groups exist in the following areas: transport and communications, education and competence, international co-operation. In addition to the permanent groups, separate project organisations can be established. The Eastern Norway County Network also has its own secretariat.\",\"In a context of under-developed public transport, improvements in road infrastructure will transform motorcycle dependency into car dependency, but will not help manage overall motorisation rates. It is thus important for Hai Phong to plan upgrades and extend its road network in tandem with effective demand management policies. New road infrastructure should also take into account the need to prioritise road space for public transport. Examples from selected OECD and non-OECD cities exhibit complex policy options and their consequences (Box 2.5).\",\"In other (Ljubljana with one option and Riga with four options), the capital city with more options achieves higher public transport demand. Therefore, for a city where bus service is the only available option and the policy goal would be to increase the demand for public transport, the introduction of a second mode may be worth a relevant consideration, especially if peer cities offering more options do reach higher demand for public transport. For the length, it is interesting to note that the capitals with the density between 900 to 1,600 inhabitants per square kilometer reach similar results for both measurements (figure 2.17.).\",\"Unchecked construction has contributed to chaotic urban sprawl and invaded agricultural production areas and forests. The distribution of public services has thus been affected and areas with environmental value damaged and agricultural land reduced. The quality of housing and appropriate transport connections to urban centres and jobs can be taken as an indicator of population well-being.\",\"It will apply 24 hours per day, seven days a week, and will include fewer exemptions. It will also require most every vehicle in London to meet emissions standards or pay a surcharge on top of the congestion charge in case of noncompliance. As such, the objective of the zone is not to ban carbon-intensive travel entirely, but to allow low levels of infrequent travel at a cost.\",\"Particularly vulnerable to inequitable access are older and disabled people, economically disadvantaged individuals, women, young adults and those who live in remote and rural communities. The main focus was on why transport planning is failing to provide adequate transport services to large parts of the population. Discussants were Robert Cervero, Director of the Transportation Center at University of California, Berkeley, USA, Chantal Duchene, ChD Mobilite Transport, France, Angela Glover Blackwell, CEO of Policylink, USA, David Lewis, Senior Vice President of FIDR Corporation, Canada, and Professor Geetam Tiwari, Chair of the Indian Institute of Technology. It ensures access to basic needs such as education, health services, shopping, social interactions and working.\",\"Legally, the UZR data system should be created based on information extracted from the approved urban design projects, cartographic materials, geological surveys, environmental and statistical data, and other information important for regulation of city development. The UZR must be used not only for implementation of architectural and construction control, but also for property taxation, and development and implementation of urban design projects such as general plans. Not all city administration can afford to have workable decision support systems.\",\"Target E, to be met by 2020, is a small indication of what is required to accomplish the goal and outcome of the Sendai Framework. It is a stepping stone towards achieving this by 2030. Again, there are good examples of countries implementing this at national level, but so far, there has been insufficient time and information to determine whether these measures are affecting the outcomes of development planning, in particular to prevent the creation of new risk. The evidence gained from country practices is that it has not been undertaken by many countries so far (Chapter 13).\",\"The lower limit above which a settlement can be considered urban varies greatly, between 200 and 50,000 inhabitants, which can give rise to error when comparing urban populations (and urban areas) in different countries. For example, if India's national authorities would classify populations of 5,000 or more as urban, the country would be considered predominantly urban and not rural. In Angola, Argentina and Ethiopia, all settlements with 2,000 people or more are classified as urban.\",\"One-year victimization rates (percentage) for burglary, assault\\u002fthreats and robbery in 11 countries in Africa and 30 developed countries.________________________________ Sometimes, architectural design of public spaces can restrict their free use. This mix should be intergenerational as well as intercultural.\",\"This framework would promote stronger linkages between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by a) linking sectorial policies, b) connecting national, regional and local governments and policies, c) strengthening urban, periurban, and rural links through integrated territorial development, and d) increasing subnational governments' resources in order to achieve a full access of basic services at the local level. This is also fundamental to the attainment of many other SDG targets (see figure 27). One example of a NUP and how it involves partners - from civil society, local, and international - is below.\",\"A night bus network, called “Owl Bus”, has operated at night since 2014 and is currently running eight lines, with an adjustment of routes based on big data. The vision is the highest level transport plan at the local level and revolves around three main axes: people, sharing and the environment. Under these 3 axes, the vision puts forward 11 goals together with specific implementation goals. The expected outcomes approaching the target year 2030 include: an increase in the modal share of green modes (e.g. walking, cycling, public transport) from 70% today to 80%, and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from 1.2 tonnes\\u002fyear today to 0.8 tonnes\\u002fyear.\",\"The city acquires land, prepares it for construction and use, and then sells the land to private developers. The role that the city takes on in this regard is not statutorily defined. The sale takes the form of leasehold: Amsterdam owns the majority of land in the city, and retains ownership after (re)development. Moreover, the increased value of existing property caused by investment in green and infrastructure flows in part to the municipality in the form of property tax.\",\"For instance, there is a large variety of ready-for-use technologies and business solutions in the field of autonomous toll systems, real-time traffic light optimisation, Global Positioning System (GPS)-based data collection, and real-time traveller information. However, consideration should also be given to the interactions between technologies. Smart transportation is an integrated system where efficiency depends on a set of technologies rather than on just one or a few. This also means that consideration should be given to the future development of the system, including its expansion and upgrading.\",\"What will be the consequences? Life expectancy, incomes, literacy, and access of girls to education have changed remarkably. However, beneath this global perspective lie significant and compelling regional differences, with tremendous economic growth in East Asia while Africa features dangerously low incomes and poor health conditions. The outbreak of Ebola fever and the need for a broad-based response has highlighted the great risks that deprivation can bring on local, national and worldwide scales.\",\"Although data is available for a few countries, it needs to be re-packaged to allow for disaggregation by relevant variables. Local materials provide efficient ways for energy conservation and protection from disasters. In developing economies between 7 and 10% of the labour force are involved in residential construction.\",\"In Viet Nam, whether or not a sewerage system is available, septic tanks continue to be the norm for individual households. Although households are obliged to connect their septic tanks to the sewerage network, connections are sometimes extremely difficult in cramped urban centres and residents are naturally reluctant to undergo the inconvenience of intrusive works within their properties. Moreover, not being convinced of the benefit of the sewerage system, they often object to paying for the connection.\",\"It is important in supporting people’s livelihoods, as the sector employs 7% of the population and provides 20% of Cambodian households with at least one income (ILO, 2018a). Furthermore, the incomes of GTF workers are rapidly expanding, with the minimum monthly wage in the sector rising from USD 80 (US dollars) in 2013 to USD 170 in 2018. Given that a large part of a GTF worker’s pay is non-wage, the median take-home revenue totalled USD 225 in 2017, well above the national average (ILO, 2018b).\",\"This index is a data aggregation tool that proposes an original angle to assess the affordability of a specific location by gathering data on the cost of housing and transport\\u002fcommuting. For example, poorer populations can often find themselves pushed out of newer, sustainable, transit-oriented housing developments in walkable neighbourhoods, particularly when the housing is centrally located. Prioritising the metropolitan scale in delivering housing and transport investment will help ensure a co-ordinated response to the need for economic efficiency, affordability and access to opportunity for all citizens. While regulatory barriers may drive up the cost of affordable housing development in the core, low access to transport in the periphery could drive up the total costs of housing transport for poorer households, who then get priced out of the core. An example of a strategic and practical partnership in this sense can be found in the New York and Connecticut Sustainable Communities Consortium, which offered a platform of co-ordination for housing and transport policy (Box 5.8). The initiative focused on downtown areas and\\u002for economically challenged communities along the Metropolitan Transportation Agency Metro-North railroad system.\",\"The International Association of Public Transport Authorities (UITP) has detailed the challenges of developing AV use and has offered several insights regarding their introduction. The UlTP's SPACE project places public transit at the centre of the AV revolution, aiming to give members the tools and knowledge that will enable them to provide higher quality and more efficient services. The project's objective is also to assess the impacts of automated road transport systems, develop operational concepts and new business models, and advocate for a harmonised framework that would foster the safe operation of AVs as a mode that is integrated with other mobility modes.\",\"Modernisation of district heating is thus imperative if Kazakhstan is to reach its greenhouse gas reduction objectives (a reduction of 15% in 2020 compared to the 1990 level, and of 25% by 2050). According to data from the Committee of Statistics, water losses accounted for about one-fifth of total water output in 2014, and more than half of water output in Almaty City. A large industrial city like Karaganda does not provide hot water to residents in the summer.\",\"But given the severe strain on the w'ater resources in the Valle de Mexico, investment in leakage reduction is likely to create significant returns. Tariffs are for 2015 and converted from MXN to USD using the average exchange rate for 2014. The pressure at which water can be supplied is constrained, to avoid bursting pipes. This means that water w'ill not be available to all households in the affected part of the network.\",\"For some bigger countries that share may be also well above 10 per cent (Paris and London) or around 10 per cent (Warsaw and Moscow). The rate is the higher the more centralized a country is with the capital city being the major business and industry hub attracting the various enterprises, while the jobs they create attract workers to move there. At the other end are countries with more decentralized or federal structures, like Canada, Germany or Switzerland, where the population of the capitals is under 6 per cent of the urban population, and where there are other cities with the role of major business or industrial hubs.\",\"In such a structure, the upper tier (i.e. the regional government) would focus on the providing region-wide services that benefit the whole territory, are associated with both positive externalities and some redistribution, and which demonstrate economies of scale. Lower tiers (i.e. urban areas) would concentrate on local services that provide local benefits and may be more in line with their actual resource capacity (see Table 3.6) (Bird and Slack, 2008).

Countries have also reported efforts to engage several partners including civil society, academia and private sector, in shaping policies and plans to implement the urban related SDGs. In some countries and for several targets, efforts are still at an early stage, and others are completely stalled.\",\"It requires workers telecommuting not to be covered by less than minimum labour standards under law and that firms offer similar treatment to these workers as to those working on the employers’ premises. This includes guarantees on working hours, overtime, rest days and leave benefits. Employers adopting the standard agree to inform their employees of available FWAs, offer clear and transparent approval processes for employees seeking FWAs, and appoint a senior manager to champion FWAs within the organisation, among other steps. More than 250 companies, with a combined workforce of 210 000, including many domestically-owned SMEs, quickly signed on.\",\"Congestion also exacerbates noise pollution, air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases by vehicles. Social impacts include increased stress and road safety problems (OECD\\u002fECMT, 2007). This was compared with a counterfactual average trip duration if average motorised transport speeds were 30 km\\u002fh and average trips were of the same length.\",\"The opinions expressed and arguments employed herein do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Organisation or of the governments of its member countries. There is a strong movement in Antofagasta to ensure that the city is prepared for its future and can provide a higher quality of life for its residents. Yet the ability to manage the challenges ahead and engage in a vibrant process of transformation is constrained by public governance institutions and frameworks that are not adapted to Antofagasta’s dynamic context. This chapter explores some of Antofagasta’s governance challenges, particularly with respect to financial and human resources, to the development and implementation of a comprehensive strategic vision, and to the role of citizens and external stakeholders in public service delivery.\",\"Air pollution is a particular challenge in the state, especially in the larger cities, and sustainable transportation investments are an important strategy to reduce these pollutants. In recognition of this, over the past few years, die state government has aimed to modernise public transportation in order to provide efficient and high quality services that generate less harm to the environment. It will be important to assess the impacts of these investments on air quality outcomes and mobility patterns.\",\"The policy has met with some resistance, however, due to uncertainty about the effect on congestion levels in nearby districts and on local businesses. London’s Low Emission Zone (LEZ) is a good example. Since 2008, public authorities have operated a LEZ that prohibits access by most polluting heavy diesel vehicles, and plans to apply tighter standards in 2012, under which more vehicles would be affected (Transport for London, 2011).\",\"The defining characteristics of urban settlements (demographic size, density and socio-economic diversity) render them particularlydynamicspaces. Economics of scale in production, large markets for labour and goods, and the ease of information flows in urban environments enhance productivity and innovation. As the primary spatial interface between citizens and government, cities can stimulate vibrant political engagement. Moreover, the density and diversity of cities can encourage the emergence of progressive values and institutions that promote social cohesion.\",\"Historically, the states have delegated much authority in these matters to cities and counties. State guidance is implemented by cities and counties through their comprehensive plans and zoning regulations, and, together with a plethora of special service districts, they provide municipal services to the region. Oregon provides firmer substantive and procedural direction than Washington, as reflected in the respective state planning laws.\",\"These activities are to be integrated into the city's master plan. The development of a “sustainable urban mobility plan” considers specifically the launch of light rail transit to Novopolotsk, and the development of cycle lanes, pedestrian paths, parking and transport interchanges. This project has led to the establishment of info-rooms in six locations, namely, Vileyka city, the urban-type settlements Zelva and Zhelyudok, and agro-towns Motole, Rakov and Vidonlya.\",\"The experience of Mexico City, for example, suggests that complementary resources are needed to help pay for the overall costs. The national government might allow cities to tax those who benefit most from public transport, such as employers, retailers and the owners of real estate. Charges can also be levied on automobile use, including parking charges and fuel taxes.\",\"It welcomes the efforts of cities and local authorities, and invites them to \\\"scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions and\\u002for to build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change and demonstrate these efforts. For this reason, the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management has developed the Strategic Framework on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters.376 This approach offers urban areas and cities options for strengthening risk governance, enabling these localities to access and utilize nationally generated geospatial information as well as feeding local information back to the national level. This mitigates consistent challenges regarding the provision of geospatial information and strengthens informed decision-making and monitoring, before, during and after hazardous events. However, the reality is that integrated implementation is not consistently pursued across countries or within States and regions.\",\"About 15% of its EUR 90 million budget comes from private patronage. The association was able to mobilise a wide range of institutional, cultural, associative and economic stakeholders: the European Union, the central government, the region, the departement, municipalities and inter-municipal authorities, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Marseille-Provence, the University Aix-Marseille, Euromediterranee, the Grand Maritime Port of Marseille, public and private companies, etc. All these different partners were brought together not only around a common cultural project, but also a shared vision of transforming Marseille-Provence 2013 into a sustainable territory of the Euro mediterranean.\",\"The International Council on Clean Transportation reviewed the existing and future energy sources, fuel type and quality, vehicle technology, and infrastructure available in each project city, helping identify the most appropriate clean bus technology from various options. In addition, various tools have also been developed to promote sustainable transport at the individual, city and national government levels (box 11). Hie tool offers cities a method and guidelines to rapidly assess and report on their transport status across 10 indicators (box 11).\",\"While these problems affected the efficiency and effectiveness of road-based public transportation (e.g. requiring passengers to transfer more often between feeder buses, trunk buses and the Metro), they also affected the overall public transport system, including the Metro. Transantiago’s initial design and service deficiencies dramatically increased demand for and use of the Metro system. From 2006 to 2007, the number of passengers using the Metro practically doubled, generating major congestion and service problems.\",\"The Ministry for Sustainable Development of the State of Morelos has designed a strategy for the integrated management of wastewater treatment and solid waste (Estrategia de Gestidn Integral de Residuos Solidos, GIRSEM) through which it put in place wastewater treatment policies.

According to Section 32 of RA 9003, each Barangay should have a MRF for final sorting, segregation composting and recycling. Yet as at 2011, out of 349 barangays only 101 (29%) had operational MRFs. This is mainly due to lack of financial resources as well as inadequate capacities of barangays to plan and operate such facilities.\",\"For instance, Portland’s open rules towards food vending have allowed local food truck entrepreneurs to occupy vacant spaces and create vibrant uses out of them—it has been a boon for local businesses and has encouraged tourism to the area (Southworth, 2014). Temporary land uses encourage experimentation. Across the United States, local skateboarders have taken over vacant lands—often unused public land underneath bridges—to build illegal skateparks (e.g., Burnside Park, Portland, Washington Street Park, San Diego).\",\"Not only are financial and human resources often scarce, there is also low flexibility with respect to how resources are allocated and used. This is detrimental to a city’s ability to increase the quality of life for its residents. For example, an evaluation of 2011 sub-national financing dimensions relative to cities that scored in the top five for quality of life based on the Universidad Catolica's Quality of Life Index signals a moderate to strong correlation between higher rankings and a municipality’s ability to generate own-source income and the amount of income budgeted per resident (Table 4.1).\",\"Thus, it paved the way for the creation of the RMV in 1995, also supported by federal transfers through the Gemeindeverkehrsftnanzierungsgesetz. It integrates regional and local transport under uniform and needs-based mles for the entire metropolitan area: one timetable, one price and one ticket. This includes important tasks such as tariff design, scheduling, allocation of transport services to carriers, the development of the network, the tendering of transport services, the assurance of quality and security standards, innovation (e-ticket, mobile ticket, touch&travel, R&D) as well as communication, information and marketing.\",\"In the closer term, the city aims for 80% of trips to be taken by soft modes or public transit by 2041. In designing these demand management measures, it is important for the government to be able to anticipate how people will respond to such regulations. Those who own non-compliant vehicles, for example, may decide to either buy a compliant vehicle, pay the charge, or alter their travel behaviour by diverting their route, changing their travel mode, or forgoing the trip altogether.\",\"Selected relevant national and local policies are: economic policies (which impact the economic impact (e.g. job creation) that urbanisation can bring), land, public sen\\u002fice, safety and security, housing, certain infrastructure, climate, natural resources\\u002fenvironment, mobility and social policies. Increasing coherence at the policy level can improve administrative effectiveness and resource flows at the metropolitan level.

It garners the Clean Development Mechanism to fund the project more effectively.\",\"The Strategic Environmental Evaluations (EAEs) are a promising tool for assessing the environmental impact of land-use plans, but could be broadened to evaluate the overall impact of urban growth on environmental performance and quality of life. Air pollution should be tackled through disincentives on car ownership, which may mean redesigning municipal revenue streams that significantly depend on vehicle taxes. Minimising natural hazards, notably flood risk, calls for a more comprehensive approach to managing storm-water drainage and mitigating the expansion of impermeable surfaces in urban areas. Mechanisms to offset biodiversity losses should be integrated into the EAEs.\",\"Regular events and milestones could also provide opportunities to monitor progress and celebrate achievement. The OECD average by indicator is between 0 and I. No data available on indicator 9 in Norway. Firms derive much of their competitive edge from their ability to use modem infrastructures, while societies depend on good infrastructure to ensure equal opportunity and equal access to services for citizens.\",\"As highlighted in Chapter 1, 25% of lung cancer deaths and about 17% of respiratory infection deaths in 2012 can be attributed to exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (WHO, 2014). E-bikes and e-scooters have clear advantages in urban settings where they facilitate fast and energy-efficient transport while avoiding air and noise pollution. This approach is not only fiscally responsible in that it pre-empts costs associated with expanding use of cars, but also environmentally responsible, contributing to de-carbonising transport.\",\"It comes to the conclusion that the public system governing these policies is characterised by a series of fragmented and reactive decisions that are centralised and taken with insufficient engagement of stakeholders and the citizens. Taking into account the main organic constitutional laws, ordinary laws, legislative decrees, law-decrees and supreme decrees, the legal framework amounts to more than 30 legal acts besides the General Law of Uiban Development and Constructioa1 Many of those legal documents overlap or even are contradictory to each other and require adjusting and updating consolidation. At present, the many exemptions and exceptions added over time to specific legal provisions make the system very opaque, discretional and arbitrary.\",\"Map 13.2 demonstrates the extent of the rural settlements’ shrinkage in the period 1979-2009. The 2009 census showed that 1,394 rural settlements had lost population. Statistics for the period from the beginning of 2005 to the beginning of 2014 show a decrease in the rural population of 19.7 per cent (from 2,732,110 to 2,193,379).\",\"Both parts of the outcome document—the “Quito Declaration on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements for All” and the “Quito Implementation Plan for the New Urban Agenda”—clearly enunciate three priorities that will frame the successful execution of Goal 11 and the urban aspects of the other SDGs, and lead to the achievement of sustainable urbanization in the coming decades. These priorities are: having a supportive governance structure, inventing and maintaining twenty-first century planning and managing urban spatial development, and establishing sound financing mechanisms. For overall guidance, they reference the International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning, adopted in April 2015 by the Governing Council of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). The Guidelines provide direction in establishing planning functions at several levels: national (e.g. connecting and balancing the system of towns and cities), metropolitan (e.g. regional economic development, rural-urban linkages, and ecosystem protection), municipal (e.g. design and protection of citywide systems of public space, capital investments in basic infrastructure, overall block layout, and connectivity), and neighbourhoods (e.g. site-specific design and local urban commons).\",\"In fact, there is a disincentive for the municipality to strongly advocate for its priorities. This puts municipal planning in a passive role, and in the worst case, can undermine the municipality’s autonomy and credibility for planning with citizens and businesses. Antofagasta will have to continue working within these constraints moving forward. While it cannot change the frameworks, it can be more strategic in what it implements, take a better approach to prioritising its initiatives, identify strong mechanisms by which to advocate priorities and build multi-stakeholder interest and support for its programming.\",\"This makes the severity of the congestion challenge greater than it would otherwise be, particularly around the bridges. Prices for public transport are generally low in Russia, which is partly linked to the tradition of highly subsidised public transport in Soviet times, but also due to competition introduced in the market over the past decades. Privatisation of transport services has led to great fragmentation of the market however.\",\"It will also allow a reformulation of various laws and regulations - including to the General Law of Urban Development and Construction - in line with national guidelines for the occupation and administration of the territory. The development of this national policy is a good opportunity to promote an integral approach to urban development and management, and to update, improve and enhance the efficiency of the urban planning instruments, including approval processes. It is important that the PNDU be developed with wide consensus from the relevant urban actors. Ensuring an active and wide-ranging process of consultation with key urban stakeholders (e.g. the Ministries of Public Works, Finance, Environment, SUBDERE, regional and local governments, the private sector, civil society and citizens) is crucial for this new policy to have broad authority, prestige and acceptance.\",\"As with good quality public transport, these services help make it as easy to live without a car as with one -and in some cases, more easily. While a car-free city may not be possible or even desirable in many areas, the wide palette of newly available mobility options allows metropolitan areas to flourish even as they mitigate the negative impacts of exclusive, and possibly excessive, car use. Table 1 highlights many of the main differences between the two (the author of the source recognises some over-generalisation).\",\"A total of 26 pilot smart cities have been selected from the ten ASEAN Member States (Table 2.1). The positive externalities arising from agglomeration can be offset by negative externalities when a city’s equilibrium size exceeds its socially optimum size (OECD, 2010a, OECD, 2015a). Traffic congestion is one of the key negative externalities of urban agglomeration, particularly in Emerging Asia. Congestion is a considerable challenge in many of the region’s cities.\",\"While rural-urban disparities are still significant, there are signs that Ghana’s cities are facing considerable challenges with land use, infrastructure and services provision (particularly with regard to housing, sanitation and transportation), and the absence of gainful and productive employment opportunities, especially for the youth. The critical policy challenge has been to ensure orderly and sustainable spatial development, co-ordination and planning, and measures to enable metropolitan and municipal authorities to secure adequate financing for infrastructure and services. The culprit was the Ebola epidemic that struck the sub-region, especially Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, between December 2013 and December 2015. Other contributing factors included a wait-and-see approach to governance in the run-up to the 11 October 2015 presidential election, and the adverse international economic outlook, which hurt the prices of export goods.\",\"The main participating companies were a coal-fired power plant (Asntesvajrket), a refinery (Statoil), a pharmaceutical and industrial enzyme plant (Novo Nordisk and Novozymes), a plasterboard factory (Gyproc), a soil remediation company (AS Bioteknisk Jordrens), and the municipality of Kalundborg through the town’s heating facility. This also enabled Statoil to stop flaring this gas. For instance, surplus heat from the power plant is used to heat about 4 500 private homes and water for fish fanning, and fly ash is supplied for cement production. Process sludge from fish fanning is supplied to nearby fanns as fertiliser.\",\"Clustering cadastre management functions for all types of land, real estate and registration of rights in a single agency, following a one-stop-shop principle, would be invaluable for the real estate market. It will need to regularly analyze progress of this regard and hasten it wherever possible. Preparing for this by adopting business disciplines will prove a good investment for the future.\",\"The Municipal Development Plan and the Calgary Transportation Plan both aim to build high-density complete communities linked by good transit (City of Calgary, 2014). Further improvement of public transport by innovative policy tools could be considered, including community buses or small and shared vehicles operated by the local community to respond to demand for shorter trips. Those demands cannot always be served by conventional public transport systems, but use of the most up-to-date technology could provide a solution in the future. Affordable housing in an accessible environment has been a major policy objective for many cities over the long term. The suggested approach by type of city is almost applicable to all types of cities, however, some key messages that each type of city could bear in mind of relatively high importance compared to other types are as follows: Types II (young cities, ageing rapidly) and III (young cities, ageing slowly) cities are encouraged to learn from the experiences of Type I cities how to integrate policies for affordable housing policies in an accessible environment with other policy strategies, such as urban redevelopment and public transport.\",\"Even controlling for differences between the countries in demographics, socio-economics, and land use, logistic regressions show that Germans are five times as likely as Americans to use public transport. Moreover, public transport in Germany attracts a much broader cross-section of society and for a greater diversity of trip purposes. The authors explain the success of German public transport by the application of a coordinated package of mutually supportive policies that include: (1) more and better service, (2) attractive fares and convenient ticketing, (3) full multimodal and regional integration, (4) high taxes and restrictions on car use, and (5) land-use policies that promote compact, mixed-use developments.

The high cost of land contributes to local governments joining private investors to pursue the policy of coastal reclamation because it appears a less expensive means to acquire land for additional industrial and commercial use (Montenegro et al, 2005). The proposed and already reclaimed land currently forms nearly 3% of Metro Cebu’s land area.\",\"While both plans focus on the importance of bolstering innovation and fostering the region’s attractiveness, neither explicitly identifies environmental or sustainable development initiatives as potentially important sources of growth. In contrast, the plan for the City of Amsterdam, Plan Amsterdam (2011a), specifically identifies improvements to environmental quality and the promotion of environmental technologies as an integral part of the city’s economic development strategy. Hannover, Germany, has even merged its economic and environmental departments, bringing both activities together under the same plan. While this arrangement may not suit all cities, it would be valuable to revise both County and City visions to explicitly promote economic growth through policies to improve environmental quality and impact.\",\"Whatever is more strategic but also coherent in the long run. For example, a recent report from the Dutch Financial Relations Council (2016) notes that many tasks have been devolved to municipalities in the Netherlands while their fiscal framework has remained unchanged. Thus, there is an appetite to consider how this framework could potentially be better aligned with present needs. The potential of fiscal instruments to support spatial development objectives should be a part of this discussion.\",\"International, regional and subregional organizations can also contribute by coordinating efforts on developing methodologies, collecting data and providing technical assistance to improve migration data, including those required to monitor migrationrelevant Sustainable Development Goal indicators and the implementation of the global compact on migration. As an increasing number of people live in cities, well-managed urbanization can help cities to reap the benefits of agglomeration while minimizing environmental degradation and other adverse impacts of urban growth. Urban planning is critical for the sustainable development of an urban infrastructure for providing access for all, especially the urban poor, to essential services, including safe water and sanitation, health care, education and adequate housing.\",\"The project will provide the Member States with tools and methods for mapping, assessing and communicating the status and trends of biodiversity. It also examines how the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services could support wider EU policies in the economic, social and environmental sphere. A number of case studies in the project cover themes like sustainable urban management, management of mixed rural landscapes, integrated river basin management and coastal area management.

Comparable regions face the same set of issues regarding maintaining natural or preserved hinterlands, resolving competition and tensions among land uses, engaging citizens in complex matters that do not have simple solutions, and in constructing appropriate local policies. Even though there are always issues that are specific to any area, three main topics that are also at stake in many places can be identified.\",\"These interventions are suggested to be an integral part of the New Urban Agenda as elaborated in Chapter 10. New urbanism calls for smaller lot sizes, shopping and community facilities within easy walking distance of homes, transit access, and street corridors that facilitate safe and enjoyable walking. Smart growth tools include promotion of higher-density and mixed-use development, transit use, pedestrian and bicycle-friendly design.\",\"These include: i) trying to ease the flow of imports and exports, ii) creating more financial stability and legitimacy in the country, iii) facilitating the continued flow of remittances, and iv) rebuilding and developing basic infrastructure. The NDP framework will define the country’s development priorities over a five-year period. The plan will also outline internal and external financing needs and major sources of funding and will guide the allocation of resources and prioritisation of government actions and international development support. The NPD will also serve as the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP), until a full-fledged official one is developed, and will include a vision and direction for Somalia's socio-economic development and poverty reduction. This process is ongoing and will slowly start to enhance the Federal government capabilities and responsiveness. However, the current tight fiscal space, with extremely limited revenue raising capacity, combined with the challenging security situation, makes it difficult to attract skilled professionals into the public sector, thereby limiting the government’s capacity to deliver services.\",\"It took until 2010 for the urban share of the world’s population to reach 50% (3.5 billion people). The limiting value of the urban population is likely to exceed 8.5 billion. The urban population is growing at a pace that has reached 60 million people a year and is still increasing. The calculations that follow show that we could add more than 5 billion new urban residents in the next 100 years.\",\"However, there is a national agreement- the so-called macro-norm (macro-standard) - which is a mutual agreement between the Dutch municipalities and the Ministry of Finance that determines the National Financial Municipal Fund.

(\",\"Vehicle and service improvements in the system are subject to constant negotiations between authorities and private sector leaders, rather than by periodically revised standards and clear procedures. The large number of uncoordinated individual concessionaires has made it hard for single operators to function as companies and for the different routes to be organised into a single system. Both of these trends prevent the creation of economies of scale in the sector and increase the obstacles to integrating bus services with other public transport modes.\",\"Many of these redeveloped markets have fallen into disuse, with serious adverse effects on informal livelihoods. In the 1996 Istanbul Declaration, national governments explicitly recognized “local governments as our closest partners, and as essential in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda.” In the area of sustainable development, as environmental concerns started getting mainstreamed into the development agenda, the role of local governments was again deemed as crucial when it comes to identifying local sustainability priorities and implementing attendant long-term action plans.\",\"It has adopted many innovations in station design and construction to ensure environmental and social sustainability.

To achieve these, a range of policy support measures for renewable energy projects is being used in the region, including feed-in tariffs (FITs), tax relief, capital subsidies, public investment, loans and grants auction schemes, and others. Among the main obstacles remaining are challenges in grid access, administrative barriers and energy pricing (OECD, 2017).

Thematic reviews are also tools that can facilitate international policy dialogue and mutual learning. Yet, a sectoral approach is limiting the range of opportunities that can be seized in the mral territory. Because most farms are small - and thus limited in the volume of production they can generate - it will be crucial to improve off-farm employment opportunities as a way to increase farm household income. To improve the competitiveness of mral areas, Morelos should adopt a multi-dimensional territorial approach that would facilitate the consolidation of strategic development projects in specific mral areas.

For example, the development of a BRT network is promising, yet too often remains divorced from broader urban planning efforts. The use of the Metropolitan Fund could be improved to serve metropolitan-wide challenges and advance cross-sectoral, integrated solutions to them, from transportation to environmental and spatial planning issues. Effective governance at the metropolitan level can reduce policy fragmentation and raise the productivity of cities. It can also provide the right conditions to take advantage of agglomeration effects from its proximity to Mexico City. How governments regulate land use and address public and private investment, how competencies are allocated across levels of government, and how land use is taxed, is critical.\",\"Moreover, the unspoiled coastal vistas are an important part of what makes the area attractive to new residents and new firms and is the base of a significant tourism industry'. The fact that w'ater and wetlands cover a large part of the area also limits the amount of potentially developable land, which further exacerbates tensions among competing land uses. Crucially, there is a strong desire to see economic growth continue, but also a recognition that better land management is necessary' to maintain a high quality of life that will contribute to future growth.

The range of issues which the Forum has been working on since its creation, and on which it has given interesting recommendations, reflect the challenges faced by transport in relation to society's demands.\",\"Put more simply, this implies that the largest city is twice as large as the second-largest city, three times as large as the third and so on along the uiban hierarchy. While the relationship tends to break down at small scales, it holds remarkably well for many countries across a very wide range of city sizes (Gabaix and Ioannides, 2004). There is also the question of whether Zipfs Law implies some constraints in the pattern of uiban growth, i.e. that the growth trajectories of individual cities could not change the overall city-size distribution (Duranton, 2007).\",\"Renewable energy sources are developing quickly in the country', and the BMR has considerable potential in the solar and waste-to-energy sectors.

To achieve this, the strategy is founded on four pillars: coordination, the increased institutional governance for multi-level governance, densification, promoting compact and integrated urban forms for economies of agglomeration, conviviality, meeting social needs for quality of life and equity, and productivity, ensuring urban environments enabling businesses. However, given the importance placed on urban economies and the territorial balance of economic development, successful implementation of the national urban policy will rely heavily on local governments and their institutional and technical capacity.

Inclusion is also reflected in various SDGs.\",\"For instance, the value of an agricultural plot of land rises dramatically if it receives a building permit. The key point is that this urban profit is created discretionally depending only on land-use planning criteria. Therefore, this added value should not go into the hands of the private sector but be redistributed and used for the public good. In Catalonia’s urban system, there is a minimum public participation in the uiban profits, established by law'. Green spaces and streets with all its infrastmctures systems needed (sanitation, electricity and water supply) are built and paid by real estate developers.

To facilitate cycling, or to take the place of bicycle lanes, new routes are wider than normal park connectors (six metres instead of four metres) with amenities such as shelters, toilets, lookout points, seating areas, information kiosks, bicycle parking lots and self-help bicycle repair facilities at various nodes. In 2017, Hyderabad launched India’s first electric airport taxi service with charging stations at the airport. In Singapore, Chinese automobile giant BYD teamed up with the Government of Singapore to launch a fleet of green taxis.\",\"Within their regions, PRDU aim to co-ordinate urban development, setting out the roles of urban centres, their spatial and functional relationships, connectivity and growth targets. It should also include guidelines for the allocation of national roads, highways, railways, airports, seaports and international borders, definition of settlements that may require priority treatment, the equipping and requirements of health infrastructure, energy and telecommunications. The MINVU SEREMI are responsible for developing the PRDU, which is then approved by the region’s Intendente and the Regional Council.\",\"But the story is not fully written. But to the extent that decentralization has not been fully realized in practice, many discrepancies and inadequacies have been attributed to questions of finance. Chapter 8 notes that city financing particularly in rapidly urbanizing developing countries is not keeping pace with the demand for infrastructure and services.\",\"Do national government transfers for social programmes take into account the share and diversity of an urban area's immigrant population? How strong is the urban dimension of policies aimed at addressing population ageing (e.g. attention to infrastructure needs and access to healthcare services for an ageing population)? Given that urban policies affect multiple sectors and multiple levels of government, both horizontal and vertical co-ordination is needed.\",\"Nevertheless, given its economic structure, it may be useful to think of a particular city having an optimum size. The OECD report “Competitive Cities in the Global Economy” (OECD, 2006f) shows that the association between income and city size turns negative once a threshold is reached and diseconomies of scale become more important than agglomeration economies. In general, very small and very large cities tend to have lower economic growth rates than the average urban area in the OECD (Figure 23). Medium-sized cities are half the economic size (GDP) of large ones and less than one-third of those with more than 1.5 million people.\",\"They can help raise public awareness of energy consumption and the benefits of energy efficiency (both environmental and financial) and how to implement these measures. These campaigns could help citizens by informing them of the possible energy-saving actions and their benefits. In urban areas with a higher level of awareness of such issues, citizens may need more assistance to help choose technical solutions, find companies to do the work, and determine what financial options they have.\",\"Many face a real shortage of personnel. This lack of capacity compromises the delivery of public services and effective investment in urban development projects. In several OECD countries, capacity building, in terms of human resources and financial support, has often been cited as the principal obstacle to decentralisation.\",\"The region’s outlying suburbs are underserved by its radial transit system. This is one reason why the number of cost-burdened households in the region (renters who spend more than 50% of household income on housing and transport) is predicted to increase significantly over the next 20 years (Metro, 2010a). Oregon initiated a dramatic shift in its growth management policy in 1969, before the challenges described above were appreciated. Oregon policy makers were responding instead to the spread of exurban development and the consequent loss of agricultural and forest land. The governor at the time, Tom McCall, worried that Oregon would become the centre of a megalopolis ranging from Seattle to San Francisco, “committing some of the richest farmland in America to supermarkets and suburbs”. However, no state agency was charged with managing the programme, there was no significant source of funding to assist cities and counties with the development of comprehensive plans, and the enforcement mechanism- assumption of planning by the state if a local government refused to comply - was politically unpalatable.\",\"Taking the opportunity of available technology and smartphones, UN-Habitat's Global Public Space Programme uses an open source application (KoboToolbox) to collect public space-related data on the neighbourhood, but also at the citywide level. This data collection process follows a few basic steps. First, a map of all the open spaces is prepared, in which satellite images are used to identify the open public spaces, markets, and public facilities. Thereafter, local data collectors are trained on the use of the open source application for data collection. Each assessment is then uploaded onto the server to be further analysed.\",\"The online map shows all relevant objects like buildings, roads, parks and stations as clickable objects that hold basic information and also in-depth thematic information via both open and user-generated datasets. The timeline features recent developments and future plans and scenarios as well. The full interactivity of the dashboard makes it easy to engage and respond directly to plans and projects. Everybody can share their own ideas and initiatives for the area, obtain feedback from other people and from the official institutions and, in doing so, test the local base of support. With the underlying crowdfunding infrastructure, project-based alliances can be formed and resources combined.\",\"Insecurity and risk undermine the long-term sustainability of cities worldwide. The spread of disease in cities often occurs as a result of inadequate infrastructure and services. High incidence of traffic fatalities, air pollution related respiratory infections and premature deaths, and communicable, vector, and waterborne diseases can all be related to inadequate, poor, or inefficient urban infrastructure. The number of Ebola deaths in that slum will likely never be known, as bodies have simply been thrown into the two nearby rivers.\",\"Metropolitan cities can levy both provincial and municipal own taxes. Taxes on properties represent a total of 30% of subnational government tax and 1.2% of gross domestic product. Transfers from the central government to local authorities mostly include transfers from revenue sharing between levels of government and categorical grants. Revenue sharing is divided into regular revenue sharing (RRS) and revenue sharing for decentralisation (RSD).\",\"In 1966 the concept of an “urban community” w'as created to address co-ordination problems associated with large metropolitan areas. An urban community (communaute urbairi) is a highly integrated form of co-operation for which a dozen different responsibilities are transferred from the individual constituent communes. Four urban communities were created by the national government without consultation for the large metropolitan areas of Bordeaux, Lille, Strasbourg and Marseille. More commonly however, intercommunality in France has been historically characterised by a voluntary linking of communes to accomplish a specific set of mutually agreed functions.\",\"The nine-year lapse underscores the fact that this was not just a static analysis of initial conditions leading to stable favoured actions. Involvement of area residents is key, and plans have a distinct institutional component, as the intent is to foster a social process which will affect actions by private and civic institutions as well as governments. The broader range of issues represented in strategic and other more recent planning forms ranges across housing, economic development, jobs, education, infrastructure, environment and natural resources as reviewed in the next section. Egypt, with the support of UN-Habitat, has been preparing strategic spatial plans for small cities whose population is less than 60,000.\",\"This means that gains from co-operation have to be seen by all participants as being larger than any losses that result from giving up independent action. Second in importance is the ability of potential partners to trust that their counter-parties can be trusted to follow through on commitments and fully implement the partnership. Typically these agreements are difficult to enforce if a participant shirks their responsibility, so a lack of trust can make an agreement improbable even if the potential benefits are significant.\",\"The urban population constituted 77.3 per cent. Over the period from the beginning of 2005 to the beginning of 2014, the urban population had increased by 4.4 per cent (from 6,965,365 to 7,274,775). The greatest population increase was in the capital city, Minsk, with 177,209 people, or 10 per cent, having been added in the last decade.\",\"It has also brought numerous issues related to cases whereby one person buys the titles for a piece of land, after being granted approval by the current Assembly of Ejidos, but the future leaders and administrators of the next Assembly of Ejidos may choose not to recognise the authorisation and, given the lack of officially-recorded evidence, a person is forced to pay for the same plot of land several times without ever gaining official recognition. This has also created situations in which a same plot of land belongs to several people and, due to the fact that the transfer is unrecorded, after some time people lose track of who the land belongs to. As such, during mission trips stakeholders reported the relative ease with which constructions could be undertaken on ejido soil based on the relationship of the ejidatarios with municipal authorities, often with limited compliance with urban norms.\",\"Mexico’s BANOBRAS (National Bank of Works and Public Services)15 and Turkey’s IlBank (Bank of Provinces)16 are examples of development banks that provide financing to local governments for investment projects and that could be of inspiration to Kazakhstan. These banks finance public investment in infrastructure and public services that contribute to social development and competitiveness. Local authorities are accountable only to higher-level government bodies and do not serve at the will of citizens (Makhmutova, 2006). In 2013, SNGs’ expenditure accounted for 9.4% of GDP (17% average in OECD countries) and 46.3% of public expenditure (40% in OECD countries in 2014) (Table 3.8).\",\"The fiscal consolidation stance is expected to meet the conditions of the reviews in 2016 as well. Ghana will hold its national election in late 2016, peaceful and credible elections will be key for policy continuity and for solidifying the country’s democratic dividend, especially after the closely contested 2012 elections and the judicial adjudication of the presidential elections. The urbanisation rate is projected to increase to 72% by 2035.\",\"However, it also combines elements from a top-down approach like the selection of areas, organisation of coordination meetings, developing strategies and offering guidance (Faggian, 2017|2i]). The results from this tops-down-bottom-up approach are materialised in the form of a Programme Framework Agreement {Accordo di Programme Quadro), which is a contract among the municipal association, regional and central governments. Project areas are selected through a standardised public proceeding that involves a desk and field analyses of pre-selected areas. Pre-selected areas are analysed with respect to a series of demographic and socio-economic parameters (utilised agricultural area, deforestation, hydrological risk, population losses, entrepreneurship, tourism and cultural heritage, quality of education and health services among others).\",\"Tous les 26 pays de l’OCDE qui ont repondu mentionnent f amelioration de faeces au logement comme faisant partie des cinq principaux objectifs de la politique du logement. Parmi eux, 18 pays citent explicitement f amelioration de 1’accessibility financiere. Les pays de l’OCDE utilisent un large eventail d’instruments complexes pour mettre en ceuvre leur politique du logement, mais tous ces instruments ne semblent pas cadrer avec l’objectif de faciliter faeces des menages a bas revenus a un logement abordable.\",\"The local governments in die BMA could support metropolitan-wide forms of financial management if they are developed in the future. Specific financial channels in key areas for green growth could be added to ensure that the appropriate policies are carried out. The recent merger by the Ministry of Finance of the state-owned financial firms PT Sarana Multi-lnfrastruktur (PT-SMI) and Perusahaan Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), to become the Indonesia Development Bank in 2017, with a capital of IDR 24.4 trillion, is an opportunity for Bandung City and local governments in the BMA to borrow from public banks.\",\"It will have 13 stations—six underground and seven elevated — and is scheduled to be finished in July 2018.25 A 42.1-km Jabodebek Light Rail Transit (LRT) system from Cibubur to Cawang, East Bekasi to Cawang, and Cawang to Dukuh Atas is under construction, with the first 5.8-km section scheduled to open in time for the 2018 Asian Games.26 In 2016, the share of public transport in Jakarta was 26 per cent. The Greater Jakarta Transport Authority plans to increase the public transportation share to 40 per cent by 2019,50 per cent by 2024 and 60 per cent by 2029. Thailand has 566 km of bicycle lanes across the country, and NMT policies are to be included in the master plans of all major cities.\",\"While spatial plans can condition the choices that firms and households make by determining where roads will be constructed and by indicating what land is open for development and what land is not, these are coarse tools for shaping economic growth. Overly rigid spatial plans can limit prosperity, while overly flexible plans lose the ability to manage the built environment and achieve environmental protection goals. The logic of constructing a Pole metropolitain is that the correct spatial unit for planning is an urban core or cores that lead economic growth in a surrounding more rural hinterland.\",\"Many young men and girls start experimenting with sex at a very early age, due in part to poor living conditions, absence of parents, lack of guidance, and high rates of unemployment. Many young people engage in sex while high on alcohol and drugs, thus use of condoms is limited. At any given time, about 50 per cent of 16-25 year-old girls are pregnant.\",\"Between now and 2050, the urban population of Africa is likely to triple and that of Asia to increase by 61 per cent, so that by 2050 most of the world’s urban population will be concentrated in Asia (52 per cent) and Africa (21 per cent). In 1990, 10 urban agglomerations were characterized as “megacities”, with each hosting more than 10 million inhabitants. Together, they accounted for 7 per cent of the global urban population.\",\"The VGGS promotes the restructuring of the economy and improving economic institutions towards more efficient use of natural resources, thus strengthening the competitiveness of the economy. To achieve the three objectives, the VGGS defines “strategic tasks” and “targets” and lays out 17 “policy solutions”, while the VGGAP sets out 66 “activities” corresponding to the 17 policy solutions. Each activity in the VGGAP, in turn, also defines timeframes, a lead government institution and supporting institutions.\",\"This co-ordination ensures that economic growth is promoted through the region’s municipal development agendas and with respect to environmental preservation and social cohesion across the territory. This requires that certain federal criteria be met, which do not often coincide with local government criteria. Moreover, federal government support is conditioned on the availability of public resources.\",\"To fully address all needs and challenges for children in urban settings, urban planning must simultaneously address the different scales of possible spatial intervention. However, it actually covets good design for all. In this sense, applying universal design helps create buildings, tools, spaces and learning or communication systems that are useful and usable for everyone. Universal design accommodates diverse literacy skills, and promotes designs that are safe and easy to use.\",\"During the 1997 special session on the review of five years of implementation of the agenda, the United Nations General Assembly identified transport as the largest end user of energy in developed countries and the fastest growing one in most developing countries. The General Assembly also noted, \\\"Over the next twenty years, transportation is expected to be the major driving force behind a growing world demand for energy.\\\" Subsequent global agendas have increasingly reinforced the significance of transport to global and local development.\",\"Nonetheless, already limited budgets are strained by other demands and therefore do not extend to provide for this allocation or the meeting of these targets. The role which the private sector should play in such commercial development is not well defined, either. This can be partially explained by the household registration system (Ho Khau) which was put in place in 1964 (Work Bank and Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, 2016) (Box 2.12). A technical problem is that migrants who are registered as short-term (seasonal or temporary) or returning migrants in the system are left out of urban statistics.\",\"Given those firms’ recent creation, productivity is relatively high, all of which reflects low barriers to entry and access to inputs. Critical to this 21st century technological industrial revolution is the high level of education of these mostly young new entrepreneurs. As suggested in Chapters 4 and 9, many cities experience growing concentrations of private income and wealth, but this is accompanied by a decline in, and depreciation of, public resources and assets.\",\"The costs of services may vaiy by location for at least three reasons (Tomalty and Skaburskis, 1997). First, the distance of each development from major facilities makes a difference. A development far away from an existing water treatment plant, for example, may require an additional pumping station. To be efficient, development charges would be higher in these locations.\",\"The predominantly market-drive nature of ICTs means that companies are seeking to compete by looking for new niches in the variety of services or the expansion of geographical areas. Even without incentives, this sector has seen rapid growth. There are different views about how ICTs will influence the nature of human settlements. On one hand, telecommunications could facilitate access to services when living in low population density areas, enabling the continuation of urban sprawl and suburbanization.\",\"The process of achieving more sustainable urban transportation systems designed with the principle of accessibility at their core is dependent on the participation of all stakeholders in cities, the authorities, the private sector and the citizens, along the lines of principles of democracy. A successful process will depend on effective governance of land use and transportation, where new housing and commercial planning will entail simultaneous transportation systems design, careful neighborhood design, strategic infrastructure investments, and fair, efficient and stable funding. The accessibility, in turn, is influenced by the availability of an efficient and effective transport system.\",\"Box 3.5 describes the principal models used by Transport for London to carry out such simulations. A major role of the COMETRAVI and the COMETAH will be to co-ordinate metropolitan-wide data collection and modelling. This will allow the COMETRAVI to build on the CAMe’s actions on the standardisation and improvement of mobility policies linked to air quality and the environment.\",\"It could introduce drastic changes, such as splitting up some councils. The commission radically reformed the structure and functions of local governments. For this purpose, it relied on a set of “principles” enshrined in the Government Economic Statement (1987) and sent to local authorities for information and consultation. The previous 200 local authorities were replaced by 12 regional councils and 75 city and district councils (currently 11 regions and 67 city and district councils).\",\"Urbanisation is largely driven by high rural-urban migration and high population growth. The lack of adequate policy frameworks and the weakness of institutions have significantly undermined the potential of urbanisation and the management of its associated risks. The services sector was the main driver of growth.\",\"The first step for the city is to improve pollution monitoring systems by allocating the necessary resources.

the longer term, the land use planning system under the Land Law could explore a more dynamic and flexible approach, rather than one that is definitive and prescriptive, in order to better adapt to the dynamic circumstances of urban development that directly answer to socio-economic needs. For example, there remains a struggle for the provision of open space in the dense inner-city centres. In HaNoi, between 2000 and 2010, the area devoted to parks and public gardens per capita went from 2.17m2 to 1.58m2.\",\"In addition, a large number of other sectoral laws and institutions still impact the sector of land use and management. It also means likely delays for project development, including of urban infrastructure. Importantly, given the pressing needs for development under urbanisation, the complexity and opaqueness of the system also open the door to corruption. An immediate policy action should be to review existing legislation and regulations in order to streamline the regulatory framework and reduce the administrative burden that hampers developments and land regularisation.\",\"But, when a change in land use is desired then these regulations come into effect and the proposed new use may, or may not, be compatible with the regulations. In France, in every instance the landowner has to apply to the commune for permission to alter the use. Because land use plans in France are statutory they are subject to all the usual due process requirements applicable to any law'.\",\"Using data from 4 000 households in rural Indonesia, Gibson and Olivia (2010) showed that improved access to roads and electricity positively affected both employment and income for nonfarm enterprises. The Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM) Mandiri Rural Infrastructure Support helped villagers of Trimulyo to develop the local economy by constructing an all-weather road. The new road lowered transportation costs, which allowed greater use of fertiliser and in turn increased outputs.\",\"For each target area, one or more municipalities have the political responsibility to establish an action plan. In 2013, a Structural Plan for Northwest Skane was adopted. The purpose was to strengthen the regional aspects of spatial planning. The plan is used among member municipalities as a strategic document in their work on long-term planning, such as the revision of municipal master plans.\",\"It includes an assessment of: I) demographic changes over time, 2) economic performance and diversity, and 3) long-term growth challenges. It analyses the environmental performance of the city and indicates where opportunities for green growth lie. It includes an assessment of: 1) transport and land-use trends, 2) energy performance, 3) the risk of floods, and 4) water supply and wastewater treatment and solid waste management systems. It includes an assessment of: I) the influence of the national government on local affairs, and 2) the need for horizontal co-operation between all local jurisdictions in the BMR.\",\"Decisions should not be based on initial costs, but on a long-term perspective based on the assessment of all the costs and benefits of urbanisation. A balance between urban and mral development could help make better investment decisions that prepare for natural and man-made disasters. View the economic and social realities of the country through the lens of the right geographic scale, to identify appropriate policy packages.\",\"In inner cities, there are limits to the improvements that can be made in the context of streets that are frequently narrow, and the constrained efforts to do so often involve expropriations, evictions, and demolitions that are socially and financially costly. Moreover, even insofar as the goal of allowing more cars in parts of a city is realised through these efforts, the problems of congestion may only be shifted to other parts of the city rather than being resolved in any viable sense. Finally, reliance on the expansion of the road network also raises concerns regarding the ability of the Government of Viet Nam to provide necessary road maintenance in the future.\",\"Many of these are the result of EU legislation. The following section describes each major plan in turn including its major objectives and tools to realise them and monitor progress over time. This includes the national, provincial and municipal structural visions along with other collaborative spatial plans such as the joint regional plans of North Holland, Utrecht, Flevoland (Gebiedsagenda) and the economic agenda for the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. Following this, Amsterdam’s land-use plans are discussed, which give the greatest level of detail for specific kinds of land uses.\",\"The application is checked for compliance with various sorts of criteria which are specified nationally, such as the building regulations, the land-use plan, urban design standards, and noise nuisance standards. Additional criteria can be stipulated by both municipalities and provinces, such as demolition, felling trees. The application is tested against the criteria, and if it fails to meet one or more of them, it must be rejected.\",\"The key diagnostic messages from the questionnaires and the interview programmes organised by the OECD Team largely corroborated the in-depth assessment that the Chilean Government carried out when preparing the National Policy for Urban Development. They are fully in line w'ith the assessment that this present OECD Review has conducted for administrative and regulatory governance, digital government and deployment of ICT in the public sector, and SME development. Territorial governance is crucial, as it heavily depends on how both urban and rural areas can guarantee agreed living standards, develop and prosper. Designing and managing efficient planning and zoning policies, including construction permit procedures, has acquired increasing relevance in the light of the challenges posed by rapidly evolving societies and the globalised economy.\",\"Consequently, actual land use plans will be more constrained by regional, metropolitan and common issues and be less about very local issues of any given commune that retains the ultimate responsibility for generating a plan that will become the actual law establishing allowable land uses. With these current legislative changes the government is establishing a system that privileges regional and inter-municipal levels of governance (over individual communes) and prioritises the planning tools at those levels. It is at this level that the private interests of the land owner are confronted with the public interest embodied in zoning restrictions and specific development ordinances.\",\"Energy and water input to the agriculture sector is often measured by MONRE and MOIT, and forests being converted to agriculture activities are measured by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). However, having these data measured outside GSO using different methodologies creates a fragmented picture of green growth, making it difficult for the national and local governments to set reliable green growth targets and to monitor the progress. More generally, this is a governance challenge due to lack of capacities in national and local administrations to collect and produce the data. The lack of acknowledgement of the importance of green growth also creates difficulties in unlocking resources to produce such statistics.\",\"While in the long run the new process is probably better, there are clear short term costs that are largely bom at the local level. France is still a centralised State, and while it has greatly reduced the direct role of the national government in land use plans it remains very engaged relative to many other OECD countries. Because France has a unitary government all devolved powers can be altered, and the frequent changes in the last few decades suggest the possibility of further change in the future. Second, while France has largely strengthened local government, the direct role of the State in day-to-day administration through the prefet and the responsibility of mayors to the nation State remains.\",\"This continues to be an important policy area, as well as increasing economic opportunities and jobs in off-farm and non-agricultural sectors. Several policy initiatives include the Smart Agriculture and the 6th industrialisation of agriculture driven by the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Development (MAFRA). Better alignment with other policy areas such as education and skills policies is essential for rural growth strategies so that the regions can retain the young generation and link their skills with local assets. Decentralisation of financial resources and authority should be encouraged.\",\"Currently, spatial planning in France is increasingly integrated across thematic areas (e.g. ecosystem protection, climate change mitigation and adaptation, management of land uses) and comprehensive, in the sense that inter-municipal planning is encouraged. As far in the past as during the years of the French Revolution, a struggle took place between the Jacobins, who favoured strong central power as a way to pursue the goal of equality for all citizens, and the Girondins, who instead valued local independence. Debates in the Constituent Assembly at the time centred around whether national unity and equality before the law could be reconciled with local liberty (Schmidt, 2007: 17).\",\"The new' act has replaced around 25 separate permits for such matters as construction, demolition, spatial planning, listed buildings and the environment by a single one-stop-shop permit covering all activities. This has reduced administrative costs for members of the public and for companies. There is now one permit, one procedure and one set of submittal requirements, followed by one “legal remedies procedure” and enforcement by one authority1.\",\"To incentivise the construction of green buildings, building owners are provided Real Property tax (RPT) rebates, instalment payment of permit fees, Green Building Tax Credits and higher Floor Area Ration (FAR), all of which are dependent on the BERDE Certification of the buildings. In addition, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation adjudged Mandaue City in 2015 as a low carbon model town for its programmes promoting low-caibon technologies that were well aligned to reduce growing energy consumption as well as caibon emissions. Additionally, post occupancy evaluation of building is important as well since the feedback helps to design better infrastructure and behaviour solutions responsive to stakeholders’ needs and environmental sustainability.\",\"This will occur gradually once the legislation currently in Congress proposing PROT as a statutory planning instrument is approved. These should not be confused with the central government’s established Strategic Regional Plans (one for each region). Strategic Regional Plans are top-down documents designed as a roadmap for Intendentes to ensure the President’s Programme of Government is executed at the regional level.\",\"This may have reduced Viet Nam’s potential to fully capitalise on the rapid urbanisation. A distinctive element of Viet Nam’s approach to urban policy is a heavy emphasis on city classification, and this too will be considered. The chapter will then give attention to key urban policy areas such as transport, housing, land use management and the quality of the urban environment. A key to ‘getting cities right’ is a holistic and integrated approach to cross-cutting urban challenges, which could be well applied to the Vietnamese urban context (Box 2.1). This section applies the approach to the current national-level policy frameworks in Viet Nam, which are characterised by a complex network of policies and plans. By getting cities right (see the table below), governments can serve a greater share of the population and economy.\",\"It entails the need for co-ordination meetings, which generated some 15 000 modification requests for the current land-use plan (which came into force in October 2011, replacing the land-use plans for the 75 cities and counties of the region). The experience of Japan shows how the central government can set a comprehensive spatial perspective at national level, which benefits from inputs at regional and metropolitan levels and is reflected in strategic documents (Box 2.6). While urban planning is the responsibility of local governments in Japan, the national government plays a leading role by delivering key perspectives for future urban challenges.\",\"It is led by the Ministry of Construction of Viet Nam, which is also in charge of urban development in the country. Viet Nam Urban Forum (cont.) The VUF works as a network\\u002fplatform for discussion between all these stakeholders, and is divided into seven member groups, as follows: multilateral donor organisations, bilateral donor organisations, government ministries and agencies, professional associations and academic institutions, cities, private sector corporations and NGOs. Currently, the VUF has 150 members and plans to expand to 200 by 2020.\",\"A “use-it-or-lose-it” clause regarding land zoned for development to reduce speculation or land hoarding. This is likely to oblige developers to begin on site or to have a portion of the development built within five years of receiving planning permission. The development and operation of housing corporations\\u002fassociations has been a successful model in many OECD countries, such as Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.\",\"Overall, it is clear that cities need to involve local communities in designing appropriate solutions in order to better tackle evolving urban safety and security concerns. In so many areas—urban services, urban housing, growing inequality and exclusion, and safety and security— new challenges are emerging, even when old patterns persist. These challenges will in part frame the attempt to find a new, and more current urban agenda in order to better structure and regulate the forces of social, economic, technological and political change that are pulsing through our cities.\",\"Furthermore, business and labour organisations are represented on the body as consulting members. The work of the decision-making body is supported by a permanent secretariat with a staff of 25-30. Beyond the preparation of the Spatial Development Concept, OROK also monitors spatial development across Austria. It has developed an online tool that provides a mapping function of a variety of important indicators at the municipal and regional level and releases a report on the state of spatial development every three years.\",\"This contrasts with the older planning pattern of attending to the physical design of public buildings, streets, parks etc., A city that plans not only projects the future from past trends, it also brings the public, private and third sectors together with communities to build a collectively preferred future. In modernist planning, progress was often elusive and the benefits were often concentrated among small groups of elites.\",\"With the objective of integrating nature and biodiversity into the city, 40% of the city is allocated to man-made lakes and wetlands. As for road and transportation infrastructure, 70% of the network is allocated to public transportation with the goal to minimise private transport use. The township has 20 precincts, with the business and commercial activities concentrated in the core islands.\",\"However, they also tend not to spend a lot of money locally, since they are present for only short periods of time. Presently, agricultural land use is relatively undiversified in suburban areas. However, there are two phenomena to note. The first is that urban sprawl is occurring in stages. The first suburban ring is ageing and becoming less attractive, while the second suburban ring (to the East) is growing. The purchasing power gradient is moving further away from the centre.\",\"The IUDF is expected to contribute to strengthening rural-urban linkages, and promote urban resilience and urban safety. These goals inform the priority objectives of nice policy levers: i) integrated uiban planning and management, ii) integrated transport and mobility, iii) integrated sustainable human settlements, iv) integrated uiban infrastructure, v) efficient land governance and management, vi) inclusive economic development, vii) empowered active communities, viii) effective uiban governance, and ix) sustainable finances. The current urban legislative framework in Viet Nam, despite its considerable extent (e.g., laws, plans, strategies and programmes) (Table 2.2), has a very similar caveat as the current urban policy frameworks.\",\"City akimats are mainly accountable for the rational use of land, construction permits and the provision of land for different uses in the city. However, in practice, land-use allocation is sometimes separated from their jurisdiction because it is also the responsibility of the territorial branches of the Committee for Land Management under the Ministry of Agriculture. This duplication of tasks by local government and by representatives of the central government presents many difficulties for land-use management.\",\"These approaches either respond to the interests of the better-off, or they focus only on strategic economic interventions in specific spaces, all of which tends to create enclaves of prosperity. The proposed third component of the New Urban Agenda aims to respond to this structural transformation for the sake of shared prosperity and harmonious, sustainable development. This city-wide integrated response puts urban authorities in a better position to optimize existing resources and harness the potentialities of the future. The New Urban Agenda should respond to all these local urban contexts with appropriate policy instruments and actions (Box 10.2).\",\"Within this discussion it is also important to consider the interdependencies between the system of local taxation and finance as a whole. In the wake of the 2008 recession, the 2010 Crisis and Recovery Act was adopted in order to speed up the planning process by reducing or simplifying some of the permit requirements. At the same time, there were emerging discussions about how the spatial planning system could be further simplified and how' it might better address some of the growing tensions betw'een economic and environmental agendas that are embedded in sectoral policy responses. The national government forwarded a view that existing sectoral policies are increasingly ineffective in dealing with the interconnectedness of projects, activities and land uses. A policy brief at the time notes that “it is difficult to meet societal challenges relating to economic development, flood protection, supplies of raw materials, water and sustainable energy, housing, accessibility and agriculture while at the same time protecting environmental quality, nature and cultural heritage” (Government of the Netherlands, 2012: 3).\",\"The planning advice certificate (icertiflcat d’urbanisme) is issued by the mairie or by the prefet and provides general planning information on a particular site. It may be best described as an “in principle” planning consent, it does not give planning permission for a particular project, for which specific approval must be sought but it does suggest that the proposed use is allowable within the current law. Planning certificates are useful documents in that they offer a strong assurance for routine developments, but they do not provide the same level of guarantee as planning permissions and they contain far less detail. In cases w'here there is a first division of land for one or more new dwellings, a special kind of consent called a declaration prealable or a permis d'amenager (where more than one dwelling) is required.\",\"Overall, it is also characterised by high fragmentation and low co-ordination as well as slow' planning and delivery' performances relative to a dynamic economic and social context. The elements included in this section combine considerations on the causes of inefficiencies and drivers for possible change and describe initiatives that the government has recently undertaken or is currently considering to address the challenges. These two acts also regulate the process for applying for and issuing construction permits (Box 9.8 below').\",\"In urban areas near international borders, the implementation of smart trade initiatives can help to improve cross-border transportation and trade (Box 2.8). Co-ordination is needed across different levels of government to develop spatial and strategic planning that will foster synergies and avoid duplication and conflict in planning within and between cities and regions. Among OECD member countries, spatial planning considerations are increasingly important, while in some countries, such as Denmark, Finland and Norway, spatial planning takes into account land use and other related matters (OECD, 2011).\",\"Chung (2015), who analysed data for Viet Nam’s 63 provinces from 2006 to 2010, likewise showed that investment in infrastructure helped reduce poverty rates. Investment in infrastructure can spur local development (cont.) In the province of Papua, the proportions drop to 29.6% and 19.4%, respectively, compared to more than 99% in both measures in the province of Bali (OECD, 2018a).\",\"The situation would become even more complex when such matters as environment, economy, education or transport and communications were taken into account. The decision for this institutional shift was approved by the government and Parliament, and the new law will be in force as of 1 January 2013. The Ministry of Infrastructure remains in charge of housing and local planning.\",\"These tools are contributing to the growing science of cities. This initiative envisions the use of circular economy techniques to link an urban extension to existing settlements. The initiative aims to incen-tivize ideas for decentralized, closed-loop models of spatial planning and peri-urban service provision that replace fossil energy with renewables, derive new water, biogas, and fertilizer from wastewater, and produce food and biofuel with recycled inputs, all co-generated at near net-zero waste. Each RENEWW Zone would offer, within walking or cycling distance, a green space for community recreation, recycling and sanitation services, as well as a place to purchase fresh food, recycled goods, biofuels and safe drinking water.\",\"Enhancing the dynamism of underperforming cities could, on its own, have a visible effect on the aggregate performance of the countries concerned and would also be likely to generate positive spillovers for the surrounding regions. Unemployment has increased in metropolitan areas in almost all OECD countries (Figure 5.1). Over the period 2007-11, the total number of unemployed in 207 large OECD metropolitan areas for which data are available rose by over 56% (with a peak at over 60% in 2010).\",\"On the other hand, poorly managed urbanisation generates significant economic, social and environmental challenges. Urbanisation is a complex process, requiring a coordinated policy approach. As such, a National Urban Policy can bring together national sectoral policies which affect urban development and help to clarify roles and responsibilities across ministries as well as between the central and local governments. The role of National Urban Policy was widely recognised during the Habitat III process.\",\"While their role has been reduced over time, they continue to exercise responsibility for enforcing national law's and regulations at the region or departement level. A central responsibility of prefets is to manage police, fire and other public safety organisations, and to head all local public services that are delivered directly by the national government. Regional prefets have authority over departemental ones and their activities are formally co-ordinated through the Regional Administrative Committee.\",\"Another reason for the shift is political. Is it necessary' and desirable that public bodies undertake activities w'hich could alternatively be carried out by developers? In answer to this question, most developers do not want municipalities to withdraw from land development because the developers benefit from close co-operation, rather than conflict.\",\"Green growth aims to steer economic growth in a different direction, addressing externalities and other factors poorly served by current measures of economic activity. It also recognises that environmental policies that do not support economic growth and wealth creation are not sustainable in the long term. The definition for green growth in cities differs in that it explicitly takes into account negative environmental externalities.\",\"In this way, cities may more effectively deliver on national-level environmental and economic objectives - whether or not they are identified as “green growth”- than national-level policies. Ultimately, the key metric here concerns not employment growth in the green sector but the aggregate employment impact of moving to a low-carbon economy. As an indicator, this must be seen as second-best, but a feasible second-best. Increasing the supply and demand of regionally produced green goods and services, which we define as those that reduce negative environmental externalities, the impact on natural resources and the pressure on ecosystem services.\",\"However, national laws stipulate that rents can be raised in designated monument areas, which then impedes upon the desire for mixed neighbourhoods. Some academics have declared the end of the planning doctrine alongside a diminished role for the Dutch social welfare state. In particular, it has been argued that the “green heart” as a national policy concept was a cornerstone of the planning doctrine, and that its demise thus marks the end of this approach (Faludi, 1991,1999, Faludi and van der Valk, 1997, Roodbol-Mekkes, van der Valk, Altes, 2012). In support of this argument, between 1989 and 1993, the population growth rate in the “green heart” was 4.8% - which was higher than the national average over that time at 3.0%- indicating that the area does indeed face development pressure (Needham, 2014: 46).\",\"The causes of such issues are therefore both institutional and political (OECD, 2016a). For example, in 2015, MOC worked with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) to develop a comprehensive set of Urban Green Growth Indicators, with 40 indicators under four categories: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, social inclusion, and institutional responsiveness. The indicators span across key green growth sectors including energy, w'ater, air quality, waste and transport (Table 3.5).\",\"Such services are regulating (purifying air and water or mitigating floods), provisioning (including supplying food, water, or medicines) and cultural (covering aesthetic, spiritual, recreational, and intellectual benefits). Indeed it is more accurate to affirm that cities are ecosystems than that cities have ecosystems. It is a key tool for promoting a city’s biodiversity objectives, relying on urban green areas as entry ways for flora and fauna from beyond the city system. Each can be divided further into specific biotopes - living spaces that provide suitable conditions for the development of certain living organisms - or localized elements, such as trees (in the green system), sidewalks (grey) and ponds (blue). All three are of equal importance.\",\"All 11 162 municipalities in Viet Nam are classified as either “urban” municipalities (wards and townships) or “rural” municipalities (communes). By the end of 2015, 2 184 municipalities (1 581 w'ards and 603 townships) were classified as urban, which accounts for 20% of all municipalities. The current definition examines each municipality and gives urban or rural status individually, instead of looking at functional boundaries and connections among these municipalities. As a result, 63 FUAs are identified in Viet Nam which cover 7% of the national territory and host 41% (37.1 million people) of the population in 2013. Out of the 63 FUAs, 12 are classified as metropolitan areas (with a population of 500 000 or more).\",\"All public and private projects located in PUD areas within Mandaue City are obliged to comply with this ordinance (with heritage or cultural buildings and post-disaster infrastructure exempted), while other projects have the choice to comply with the ordinance, or not (IIEE, 2015). The city lias also employed the use of the Building for Ecologically Responsive Design Excellence (BERDE) Green Building Rating System as a tool to measure, assess, verify and monitor the environmental performance of building projects in terms of management, use of resources and mitigation of emissions. The Green Building Ordinance requires building owners to use environmentally-friendly construction methods and resources that would have less damaging effects on the environment.\",\"In the case of both types (communal or intercommunal) building permits are delivered by the city council of each town. This commune’s role is to develop a land use plan that reflects its priorities, but in a w'ay that is consistent w ith national and regional planning guidelines in accordance with its devolved competencies over land-use. Since the adoption of the Law for Housing Access and Renewed Urban Planning (ALUR, 2014), there is some disconnect between plans at the intercommunal level (with the PLUi), and land-use and building permits w'hich remain under municipal jurisdiction.\",\"Spatial frameworks are often used to give structure to urbanisation processes typically at the metropolitan scale. In France, for example, city contracts between the national government and inter-municipal bodies and municipalities have been an effective policy instrument (Box 6.1). Spatial planning legislation is a common instrument for managing urbanisation, though this is not necessarily articulated at the national scale. Regional planning frameworks are widely applied, some of which reference national policy settings or, in the case of Europe, supra-national frameworks.\",\"It can be difficult to manage the increased congestion generated by higher density development. Constrained uiban areas may also be less economically efficient. They may also generate environmentally undesirable commuting patterns (due to leapfrog development, for example). No single best solution or tool exists to manage urban growth without negative side-effects.\",\"Urban planning helps cities accommodate growth and adaptation in a sustainable way, to upgrade the existing built environment to a more sustainable one (hardware) and to manage related risks and needs of communities in order to make them more resilient (software). As local implementation is highlighted, many development programmes remain 'spatially blind'. When many interests are superimposed on the same urban space, conflicts arise that often lead to spatial inequity, and thereby marginalising the disadvantaged.\",\"The “explicit” rural-uiban partnerships (five in total), deliberately set out to cultivate a rural-urban partnership or manage rural-uiban relationships. This “intent” is reflected in the objectives of the partnership agreement. This rural-uiban dimension is a core aspect for the partnership that is deliberately pursued, either through the issues identified, initiatives realised and\\u002for stakeholder involvement.\",\"Yet in the longer term, approaches which better address goals of green and inclusive growth should offer the surest paths to lasting and sustainable development for all urban areas. Addressing this challenge necessitates the timely application of a clear and workable urban policy framework. However, the adoption of ambitious national level urban policies since 2000s has not necessarily been successful at least in two ways. First, the succession of plans and programmes has introduced complexities that had the net effect of allowing ad hoc approaches to urban development to prevail.\",\"While the SCoT was initially conceived as a tool to help larger communes manage land that was outside their direct control, this was too narrow a perspective. Because a SCoT requires agreement among the members, it must consider a broader set of interests, including those of the smaller communes that also play a key role in the organisation because of the increasing expansion of the whole urban and peri-urban area. Questions about: local economic development, mobility, and the role of local food and farmland preservation, need to be approached at a larger scale.\",\"Land use plans can direct the land market. Sectoral plans in transport, housing, utilities, and other sectors can be tied to the goals and milestones of comprehensive or strategic spatial plans. Metropolitan planning is vital to coordinated natural resource and infrastructure decision-making, but often run into power games, political resistance is strong in many countries municipal officials resist ceding authority to regional counterparts whilst national officials resist creating strong contenders so as to maintain political bases. Line service delivery agencies are not likely to follow national or urban plans that conflict with their own agency plans, or that are the product of decision p which they had no involvement.\",\"These are interlinked areas yet, there are power dynamics that can undermine co-operation efforts. For instance, peripheral communes tend to want to retain influence and related to this, tactics may waver from subordination to co-operation with the main city depending on the issues at hand (Box 2.4). Smaller communities may feel like they will be subsumed by urban priorities for growth, and thus seek to maintain independence.\",\"These conditional urban developments do not include land-use zones but must provide their own infrastructure and basic services (SERPLAC Santiago, n.d.). The primary exception to restrictions on building outside of the urban boundary is found in Article 55 of the General Law of Urban Development and Construction (Ley General de Urbanismo y Construction), which allows certain land uses outside urban boundaries, including social housing, services, infrastructure and industrial uses. For example, the current system of zoning has been seen as an obstacle for new development, and zones tend to become obsolete more quickly than PRs are renewed (Peterman, 2008). Others have indicated that the zoning system limits opportunities to redevelop under-utilised areas within urban boundaries for new types of uses, such as multi-family housing (Trivelli, 2011). The pressure to develop beyond the urban boundary has contributed to the rise of conditional urban developments in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which may undermine city-wide urban development strategies (Trivelli, 2011).\",\"The Polish land-use planning law also refrains from granting the Ministry of Infrastructure any direct regulatory powers over local planning beyond national roads, nature reserves and the like. While the ministry does play an important function in issuing regulations for making local plans, these tend to focus on technical rules, such as how to calculate the need for public services. Only a small part of the country is covered by approved Municipal Physical Development Plans that are in accordance with the 2003 Spatial Planning and Spatial Development Act, which are produced at neighbourhood scale. While the share of land covered by these plans in cities with county (poioiat) status has increased from nearly 11% in 2006 to 17% in 2008, this leaves a significant share of city land that is not managed by Municipal Physical Development Plans (Table 2.4). Only Gdansk is fully covered by Municipal Physical Development Plans (Sleszyhski et al., In Poland, unlike many OECD countries, the law does not require the preparation of any overall citywide plan, and cities have not adopted this mode as a good practice.\",\"As in previous practice, each block in the module is planned to have green spaces for recreation, inbuilt groundfloor spaces for social-household services and educational and operational premises, and inground parking. This project is expected to last five years and involves three cities (Novogrudok, Novopolotsk and Polotsk) as pilot projects for realizing some elements of a \\\"green city” approach to urban development. The results of these projects are expected to provide best practices that will be adopted in at least five other cities in Belarus.\",\"This investment has been framed within specific state programmes. It has provided the basis for other local initiatives aiming to improve the cleanliness of residential and public territories and restore the natural environment. Rural settlements form groups interlinked with each other and with urban settlements - centres of administrative rayons - through administrative, economic and sociocultural ties and transport networks.\",\"To set up the PLU and the carte communale, municipalities must go through a public hearing and cooperative procedure with the central government. When development does not conform to the plan, it can legally be refused connection to infrastructure such as electricity and water grids. Comprehensive land-use planning in France and the Netherlands (cont.)\",\"This data shows that nearly all of the world's large urban areas have extensive suburbs of much lower density outside the central cores that are characterized by higher densities, in most cases. Some post-automobile urban areas have virtually no urban cores at all.xxiThese findings are backed by a joint study by UN-Habitat, New York University and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy on a representative sample of 200 cities across the globe, which established that the average rate of the physical expansion of cities is about one-and-a-half times that of their population growth. By measuring the rate at which cities consume land compared to their rate of population growth, city authorities and decision makers can project demand for public goods and services, identify new areas of growth, and proactively influence sustainable urban development.\",\"Significant research has been pursued in the academia and the public and private sectors on these issues. A further goal has been more effective land policy implementation. The role of these land policies, when coordinated with planning and zoning tools, may be very important for eliminating informality, since the authorities can monitor ownership rights and land use, plan more effectively and eliminate illegal occupation of public land. While these measures have not explicitly targeted the informal settlement problem, in general terms they have provided better spatial data infrastructure for urban planning and management with respect to general compliance with the existing planning and building regulations.\",\"Resolutions require 12 out of 15 votes to pass.

In addition, communal master plans (PMC) need to be submitted to CORE’S approval if they are not included in existing PRI or PRM.\",\"The Land Law establishes the rights of the government and of land users, stipulates the requirements of land use planning, and the mechanisms for land allocation, renting and withdrawal. It also regulates land use right registration, and land financing and pricing. The 2003 Land Law further opened the land market, and guaranteed and concretised land rights through the system of building ownership and land use certificates (BOLUCs) and land use rights certifications (LURCs), which constitute a form of “title”, on the basis of which the market exchange developed.\",\"For example, fast-growing cities in Viet Nam, as elsewhere, lack public transport to accommodate travel from suburb to suburb as opposed to a purely radial system designed to move people only between a given suburb and the core of the city. In addition, silo approaches, in which the transport sector lacks co-ordination with other sectors such as construction, land use and housing development, often create a spatial mismatch between the demand and supply of public transport, resulting in inefficient public transport networks and perpetuating inequality'. Housing will be built in areas where land is cheaper, meaning most frequently that low-income residents will be located in outlying and peripheral areas where public transport is either non-existent or is so expensive that ridership is limited and investment is accordingly difficult to mobilise. Indeed, nearby municipalities may come into conflict with one another if they perceive that a neighbour is lacking in commitment to transport integration or is unwilling to invest in a way that is equitable to all partners.\",\"Municipalities thus often formulate structure plans to show the consistency of land-use policy in the municipality . Land-use planning falls mostly into the jurisdiction of local governments since it is place-based by definition and context-specific (OECD, 2017, forthcoming).

This supports cities in identifying opportunities for sustainable resource management and can be linked with infrastructure to find alternative ways of using resources sustainably. The system can be fully adapted to suit the local requirements and policy priorities.\",\"Chile’s fragile ecosystems in the Andes, coastal areas and deserts have experienced continuous biodiversity losses due to extensive, partly unplanned, urbanisation. This calls for an integrated approach to biodiversity within urban and regional development plans. Other OECD cities, such as the City of Edmonton, Canada, have successfully integrated their biodiversity strategy with urban planning (City of Edmonton, 2009).\",\"Urban development and management are no exception, and the need for well-integrated approaches to managing urbanism has become ever more apparent. Chile’s practices in this area have been governed by a series of discrete instruments and mechanisms that, while appropriate when they were first introduced, may be ill-adapted today to meet the demands of the country’s dynamic urban reality. Greater flexibility and a unified approach to urban issues could help improve urban outcomes for residents.\",\"In the meantime, 14 out of 15 regions have established PROT. Not only does this mean double planning, but it calls into question prioritisation - i.e. which plan is given precedence for implementation in those cases where PROT and PRDU have both been approved. Given the similar aims of both planning documents and the weaknesses of the PRDU (a top-down development process with complex and long approval and amending processes and hence limited flexibility), it may be wise to redirect the focus of regional energies from developing a PRDU to developing and\\u002for implementing the PROT.10 This could help address the problems of overlap as well as an inefficient use of scarce resources - financial, human and infrastructure.\",\"It is important to emphasise that eliminating zoning will not address the problems of social segregation and segregated land use if conditional urban developments are not grounded in a city-wide vision for urban spatial development. The German zoning system provides a useful example of an approach that relies on zoning, and also allows for flexibility and a mix of uses throughout most of an urban area. As in single-use zoning, land-use zones are separated into categories, such as residential, commercial, industrial and mixed use. However, in each zone, other uses are also allowed either automatically or based on conditions (see Table 2.4).\",\"Planning is about making such choices, no guidebook can short circuit the need for planning. Often, the direct role of government has decreased— in favour of the private sector and civil society— and “Governance” has frequently replaced \\\"government. In the past, master planners saw the plan as their central accomplishment.\",\"This criticism seems appropriate again today, given the number of “new city” projects which in many regions seem to emulate the modernist designs of Le Corbusier, i.e. “vertical\\\" cities of skyscrapers and urban highways. Rather, lessons from several decades of policy practice and programme assistance should be reflected in the design of urban extensions and infill projects in existing cities and towns. In this respect, public authorities can learn from the experience of international development assistance and, more positively, carefully selected best practice.\",\"Such a move towards inclusive policymaking had not been witnessed before, especially considering the country's recent history of conflict. So far, multiple stakeholders had jointly validated 10 policy focus areas, along with three overarching interventions.

It combines new and old Soviet-era \\\"micro-rayon’’ solutions, including territory of a smaller size (15-20 ha vs 50 ha), housing with a reduced number of storeys (S 5), more compact development, underground parking to provide more space for common areas, job opportunities within walking distance in ecologically friendly industries, energy efficient buildings, and a choice of centralized or decentralized utility systems. Emphasis is given to the development of intimate spaces with good quality infrastructure and amenities.\",\"However, they are cross-sectoral in nature, and within an urban context, they form part of an integrated urban system. Urban public policy interventions ideally should be designed for and reflective of this dynamic relationship. Chile’s urbanism actors are aware of this need, but there are few mechanisms to support such a practice, and each sector appears to strike off on its own.\",\"This should also be a prerogative for regional governments to support coherent rural-urban spatial strategies. Such evidence-based assessments will help establish priority areas for collaboration. Austria’s Conference on Spatial Planning, which assembles representatives from all levels of government to discuss spatial policies, is one of the best examples of multi-level government spatial co-ordination within the OECD (Box 4.9).\",\"The challenges are due at least in part to the centralised administrative and financial system in Chile. Local governments in Chile depend largely on central government transfers and have limited sources of own-revenue, leaving few resources available for additional investment measures. Only the wealthier localities can afford to use their own-source revenue to invest in local economic development initiatives (OECD, 2009).\",\"The New York City Green Infrastructure Plan requires USD 2.4 billion of investment from the public and private sectors, in swales, green roofs and other source controls to manage runoff. This will have further benefits, including cooler temperatures, improved air quality, more green space, lower energy bills and higher property values. New York City’s Green Infrastructure Plan will change the city form and reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 12 billion gallons per year, 2 billion gallons more than the existing grey strategy, at a savings of more than USD 2 billion over the 20-year implementation period.\",\"For example, within NUDP, targets are set for the percentage of the population in Class IV and Class V cities which would have access to clean water by 2020 (90% and 70%, respectively).

Especially, fostering green growth in cities is critical because cities play disproportionately large roles in the economic and environmental performance of countries (OECD, 2013) (Box 3.1). To do this it must catalyse investment and innovation which will underpin sustained growth and give rise to new economic opportunities” (OECD, 2011). The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) defines green growth as “a development approach that seeks to deliver economic growth that is both environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive” (GGGI, 2017).\",\"While this process may be predicated on the idea that increases in autonomy and financial transfers will benefit the absorbed areas as well as the original city, in reality there are no guarantees that the social and physical infrastructure will be adequate for what may now be a greatly expanded and more complex area. Another concern is that, given that population density is given little regard, this results in cities paying less attention to developing dense and well-connected urban environment, by instead favouring ad-hoc development which can quickly add to their population figures. This will make the provision of public services, such as wastewater treatment, solid waste collection and mass public transport extremely costly and inefficient. In this way, the classification system may also have an impact in limiting longer-term economic investments that may suit the particular characteristics of a given city.\",\"The spatial structure and economic development of cities are the most prominent components of these national urban policies. When policymakers decide on important issues such as poverty reduction and economic development, then they classify the activities as either rural or urban. In many instances however, this distinction has been used to show differences between the two settlement patterns, and consistently has overlooked their interlinkages, complementarities and synergies.111' This has been against recorded historical development trends which have shown that, urban-rural linkages include important flows of people, natural resources, capital, goods, ecosystem services, information, technology, ideas and innovation. These are important drivers of economic activities and contribute significantly to overall poverty reduction in a region.*1\\\"This illustrates interdependent, intertwined and complementary functional and productive settlement systems.

Public supports are focused on improving basic living infrastructure in general village districts and in contrast larger investment is made in leading districts so that they can function as the business and service hub in the region.\",\"Furthermore, Henderson (2014) argues that we do not yet know enough about the economic dynamics of urban systems to attempt to influence them, and such attempts risk a major policy error. Very large investments may therefore be needed for some smaller cities to reach this threshold (Altbeker, McKeown and Bernstein, 2012). Policies to invest in transport links between cities and improve urban-rural links have been shown to improve balanced productivity (AfDB, OECD and UNDP, 2016, UNECA, 2013). Additionally, industries with intensive use of immobile primary factors that are not heavily dependent on other firms for intermediate goods and services may prefer to locate in smaller cities—if infrastructure is improved (Henderson, Shalzi and Venables, 2001).\",\"The available space should be used efficiently and excessive programming avoided. The authorities concerned assess whether the intended development meets a regional, inter-local demand for industrial sites, offices, residential buildings, retail developments or other urban amenities that has not been met elsewhere. Besides a quantitative assessment (number of hectares or number of homes), there must also be qualitative demand (e.g. an industrial site where a heavier environmental burden is permitted or a specific type of living environment) at a regional scale.\",\"They also have access to various EU funds that are made available outside the national budget process.

The role of regions in spatial planning has recently changed.\",\"Recently decentralized governments often struggle to And resources necessary to fulfil their responsibilities.63 Planning in transitional countries is diverse, reflecting the divergent paths of economy and politics chosen. In most cases, economic and physical planning are separated institutionally, making the kinds of integrated planning discussed in this chapter difficult to achieve. Levels of income inequality are staggering.\",\"Essential elements for such a planning instrument have been identified according to international good practice (Box 2.3). Transparency and predictability in development control mechanisms will increase the credibility of the city master plan and help to promote private investment under the plan. Viet Nam has a unique land ownership system with Land-use Rights (LURs) (Box 2.4), and development control in urban areas is based on zoning. Effective enforcement is another urgent challenge (see Chapter 4).\",\"International academics have variously extolled the country as having “one of the world’s most successful systems” (Alterman, 1997), as being a “world-wide lead” in the co-ordination of spatial and transportation systems (Hall, 2007), as “the most planned country among the European nations” (Dutt and Costa, 1985) and as no less than a “planners paradise” (Burke, 1966). Fainstein has dubbed Amsterdam a “grounded utopian actual city that, w hile not, of course, really utopia, offers a picture of possibility, at least in relation to the Anglo-American city” (2005: 127). In sum, there is strong consensus among many experts that there is much to leam from the Netherlands’ oft-studied spatial planning system. What some view as success - such as “the containment of open space in the Green Heart and buffer zones between agglomerations” - others view as problematic (Roodbol-Mekkes, van der Valk and Altes, 2012: 378).\",\"In many cases, these illegal structures have since gained community buy-in and have been turned into official skateparks sanctioned by municipalities, thus changing their temporary land uses into permanent features of the urban landscape. Though initially an unsanctioned experiment, their uses were proven to be beneficial and were eventually accepted. Embracing experimentation through temporary land uses (cont.) It provides costs estimates for different kinds of projects and access to data and maps of vacant land so that potential areas can be identified and linked up to other vacant sites.\",\"People also tend to be attracted to densely populated areas for the wider availability of job opportunities, goods and services. These mutually reinforcing forces yield important economic advantages for both consumers and firms: economies of scale, a better matching and functioning of labour markets, spillover effects and more technological intensity. It is no surprise that productivity, and therefore wages, tend to be higher in densely populated areas. The net impact varies from one urban area to another (OECD, 2015d).\",\"The lack of technical capacity constitutes a major hurdle, perpetuated by the loss of municipal staff and information eveiy three years following the election cycle. Although state planning officials provide training to new municipal staff on the process for obtaining funds to develop plans, three years offer a short time span for municipal staff to apply for federal funding and conduct the update. Even when municipal plans are eventually updated, their implementation remains a key challenge. A major obstacle to adequate spatial planning in some countries is the lack of an updated national cadastre. Solving this gridlock requires critical action from the central government, and in this regard, the example of recent progress achieved in Greece in terms of legal framework and financial investment is promising (Box 2.8).\",\"Urban density, on the other hand, constitutes only 5 points in the overall scheme. Emphasis, therefore, is disproportionately put on infrastructure development and population growth. As a result, local infrastructure development is prioritised above adherence to the AOMP and other urban strategies which place stronger focus on sustainability. In fact, some cities in Viet Nam have expanded their boundaries to rezone villages outside of the city to “boost” population growth (Chapter 1).\",\"Second, it implies a potential need for more intensive management of the nearby hillsides, and more precisely, the identification of specific areas that can be devoted to the needs of the local population. They reflect conflicts about specific parcels of land because some uses may be perceived as harming the interests of nearby land owners. A media analysis of land use conflicts in Puy-de-Dome illustrates this point well. It was found that the majority of conflicts are brought forward by rural residents who would like to maintain the natural environment against the land uses of businesses and industry (Mann and Jeanneaux, 2009: 129). Of the 35 conflicts identified in the area in the study, three quarters were resolved in the residents’ interest—a fact the author of the study notes demonstrates that ex-post decision protest behaviour can result in political decisions that maintain or improve the quality of residential life.\",\"The opinions expressed and arguments employed herein do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Organisation or of the governments of its member countries. Improving Chile’s urban outcomes will require adjusting its urban governance framework, including building the capacity to bring central and sub-national, public and private actors together to build a “whole-of-city\\\" approach to urban initiatives. This chapter focuses on Chile’s urban administrative structures, recent sub-national reforms and sub-national financing practices.\",\"With competing interests and stringent resources, it would be extremely difficult for them to justify allocating resources to tasks that are vaguely mandated. Currently, national green growth policies and strategies are neither legally founded nor mainstreamed into sectoral legal frameworks such as the Law on Urban Development. An important option would be to clearly state in a legally binding document that subnational governments are responsible for fostering green growth within their administrative areas. Providing clearer mandates and specific actions for subnational governments will actively steer them toward allocating their manpower and budget to green growth actions.\",\"Also required is a LURC, meaning that documentary evidence of property must be provided, which is often difficult as the majority of land transactions occur informally. Granting processes for BOLUCs and LURCs are also lengthy and involve costs for the cadastral survey, mapping and registration in the form of taxes, levies and fees that most people cannot afford and avoid by deferring regularisation (Wilson, 2016). The complexity of land registration procedures can be illustrated by the multiplicity of agencies involved: the Land Use Right Registration Office, the tax office, the state treasury and the notary’s office.\",\"Expropriation powers across OECD member countries (conl.) When local plans zone areas in a way that make it impossible for a private land owner to generate a reasonable return from it, the state can be obliged to expropriate the area and pay compensation for it. However, the requirement to compensate land owners does not cover areas used for the construction of roads. Expropriation of private land for other uses is not possible, but the state can expropriate land and sell it to another private developer. While legally possible, such a procedure would face increased political challenges and legal scrutiny.\",\"For example, given the crucial role of MOC in urban green growth, MOC could be added to one of the vice-heads of the ICB. As outlined in the previous section, out of VGGAP’s 42 actions which are relevant to urban areas, only five actions have been allocated to MOC to lead on. Currently, while green growth is assigned to DPI and climate change is assigned to DONRE, no inter-sectoral co-ordination mechanisms are institutionalised.\",\"The dominant regulatory instruments in Poland are these decisions or “decisions on the location of public land uses” (Gdesz, 2010). They are ostensibly similar to development permits, but they are detached from any local plans and do not have to conform to higher-order government policies or guidelines. Apart from selected areas governed either by national infrastructure decisions (often accompanied by expropriation) or nationally designated high-quality agricultural land, proposals for “decisions on development conditions” or “decisions on the location of public land uses” are bound by only one rule: local government may reject them if they do not meet the “neighbourhood rule”, that is, if they differ too much from their surroundings. This notion, however, is largely discretionary, and landowners often contest rejection decisions.\",\"It also establishes sectoral policies which have spatial implications in the areas of economic attractiveness and competition, transportation, local digital development, public services and finally, higher education and research. The Ministry of Housing and Territorial Equality also has an important role to play in shaping spatial policy objectives at the local level. This is a particularly French institution, although it also exists in Chile, w'here a national official exercises direct authority in parallel with local elected government on various matters, some of which have overlapping jurisdiction.\",\"It begins by reviewing the constellation of urban planning and management documents at the municipal and regional levels and their impact on coherent urban development. This is followed by an analysis of four policy areas with significant implications for national urban programming: land use, housing, transport and the environment. The General Law contains the principles, attributes, responsibilities, rights, sanctions and other statutes governing the institutions, individuals or professionals involved in urban planning, urbanisation and construction.\",\"The project promotes healthy lifestyles with educational initiatives such as a community garden club, exercise and nutrition lessons, and environment and recycling education. The development complex strengthens community engagement with social activities and an on-site food cooperative. Without planning and specification of land use for public amenities such as schools and health centres, the development cost for land acquisition and construction is high and coverage tends to be unequal.\",\"An inspiring example of such a strategy can be found in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (Curran and Hamilton, 2012, Box 5.14). The plan aimed to promote mixed-use development projects, increase green spaces, reduce water spending and tailor public spending to specific areas of the city in need of development. The plan paid particular attention to the development of open spaces and the creation of integrated connections between spaces.\",\"Moreover, government needs to i) regularly monitor and evaluate progress, ii) ensure transparency, iii) assess not only compliance with technical norms but also the local financial, human and natural resources needed for actual implementation, and iv) engage the local community. Urban sprawl, pollution, poor public services (e.g. utilities), housing shortages, and weak intra-city connectivity are all problems that stem from a lack of proper land-use planning and deficiencies in implementing land-use regulation. Three strategies could address these problems.\",\"Eliminating zoning cannot solve the problems of restrictive land uses and social segregation, as is demonstrated by the experiences of cities that do not rely on zoning. In the absence of zoning, cities still tend to be shaped by land-use rules in some form, but these rules may be driven by private-sector demand, giving higher-income areas more land-use protections, while leaving low-income areas with few development standards. For example, the city of Houston in Texas is well known for being the only major city in the United States without a zoning ordinance.\",\"Section one describes the characteristics of the area, including major features of the local economy, its population and its land uses. This is follow'ed by a discussion of the major actors involved in the governance of land use at the commune and intercommunal (metropolitan), departement and regional scales. The third section discusses the major land use plans and how they have evolved over time.\",\"It mandated that any municipality located within 15 km from the outer limit of an urban agglomeration w ould lose its right to elaborate a land use plan and give building permits if it were not covered by a Territorial Coherence Plan (Schema de Coherence Territoriale, SCoT) —a form of inter-municipal plan whereby municipalities commit themselves to integrated and joint development. This rule created a very strong incentive for municipalities to join the SCoT, but it was not enough to limit urban sprawl from persisting. Writing in 2014, a government note on the matter comments that only 20% of the territoiy is currently covered by an enforceable SCoT, and that their coverage is not wcll-connected to areas of population growth. Moreover, industrial and commercial developments have continued to contribute to sprawl.\",\"In France, as in other OECD countries, centralised planning models had largely failed to end regional economic inequality. In the process, while communes have maintained the ultimate responsibility for developing and managing land use plans, these plans have become more constrained by laws, regulations and other actions taken by higher levels of government. The specific process of devolution in France has been seen as analogous to a three act play. The Chevenement law of 1999 established new structures through co-operative institutions (EPCI) and facilitated the pooling of services and projects among communes.\",\"This broader well-being agenda does not abandon the objective to improve rural competitiveness, rather it recognises that competitiveness is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for well-being. A pooling of resources and capabilities across entities creates the ability to collectively accomplish what no individual actor can achieve independently. This demands the collaboration and engagement of government at multiple levels, and involvement of the private sector and third sector. Long term capacity building makes rural communities more engaged in processes of development and more resilient to shocks.\",\"The conference is located at the centre of government (within the Office of the Chancellor), and therefore serves an important role in carrying out the necessary cross-sectoral policy co-ordination between different branches of the national government. In France, the newly created territorial conferences for public action will promote dialogue between regions and local authorities on thematic areas. Both Austria and France have established regular conferences that provide such structure, but at different scales and for different topics.\",\"It begins with an exploration of the origins of cities providing an understanding of the main focus of urban policies. This is followed by an examination of urban planning challenges and possible ways to improve urban planning practice in the country. The largest section of this chapter focuses on possible responses to urban development challenges.\",\"The threat to halt progress on a plan generally only worries the local government preparing the plan, not the other authorities being consulted. Constructive co-operation and co-ordination of plans is clearly an important goal to ensure the best use of land and infrastructure investment. Within London and the larger English conurbations, non-statutory arrangements and statutory' joint committees are emerging as a way of guiding good planning without the creation of new levels of cumbersome plans.\",\"Chile’s Organic Law for the Constitution of Municipalities (Ley Organica Constitutional de Municipalidades\\u002fLey 18.695) establishes the right of municipalities to co-operate in order to address common problems or make better use of resources. The law permits municipalities to establish associations for a variety of purposes, including providing common services, executing public works linked to local development, strengthening management\\u002fadministrative instruments, implementing programmes for environmental protection, tourism, health or other reasons as appropriate to the municipalities, training of municipal staff, and co-ordinating with national or international institutions to improve municipal administration (Government of Chile, 1988). A legal framework for such an entity could be considered to be already in place.\",\"The work of the decision-making body is supported by a permanent secretariat with a staff of approximately 25-30. One of the central tasks of OROK is the preparation of the Austrian Spatial Development Concept (OREK, Osterreichisches Raurnentwicklungskonzept), which covers a planning period of approximately ten years and provides a vision and guidelines for spatial development that is shared by all levels of government. Beyond the preparation of the Spatial Development Concept, OROK also monitors spatial development across Austria.\",\"Consequently, large developers withdrew their interest in the site and some new guidelines were established to react to the changing conditions - namely, office space was removed and DIY builders were encouraged. Writing on the Dutch spatial planning system in the late 1980s, Needham remarked “it is probably not so much the plan itself that brings about a co-ordinated Dutch physical planning strategy, but much more the exceptional talents of the Dutch to reach compromises” (1989). The idea of a planning doctrine has been forwarded to explain this consensus-oriented approach - the idea that Dutch spatial planning actors have embraced interrelated and durable notions about spatial arrangements, development and how they are to be handled (Faludi, 1989, Faludi and van der Valk, 2013: 18).\",\"Buildings' energy accounts for one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, and if today's context continues, this share is predicted to rise. The low-carbon transition can be accomplished through energy-efficiency measures, behavioural interventions and incorporating carbon sinks such as urban parks. Cities and their energy systems should be resilient to natural and human threats.\",\"The urban population has increased rapidly since 1950, metropolitan areas and large cities have grown in size, and urban challenges have risen in number and complexity. These changes demand adaptable planning instruments. However, the complex administrative procedures for approving or amending Regulating Plans, and the number of documents required when submitting them, result in lengthy and intricate administrative and political processes, and raise several challenges. In the case of the PRC, the documents to be presented and the number of steps for approval are the same regardless of whether the proposal is a new plan or an amendment to an existing plan. Approximately two-thirds of Chile’s municipalities are either developing or amending their plans (see Table 2.1).\",\"The new approach was initiated in two lower-income districts, Bronowice and Kosminek. In 1994, the Local Initiatives Programme was scaled up, to guarantee its continuity as a key environmental improvement strategy. The programme ensures that public and private stakeholders engage in cost-sharing partnerships to develop infrastructure and finance environmental improvements. Lublin has created an enabling environment for private investment in housing and microenterprises.\",\"It is presently unclear how land use planning is going to evolve with all the changes implied by the wave of recent legislative changes (e.g. ALUR, MAPTAM and NOTRe). Intercommunal power is increasingly emphasised and the new regions (13 instead of 22) should have more influence on planning. But, with the tradition of the commune’s monopoly in term of land use, regions are uncertain about their areas of competence. While the intent has been to make the process of planning more co-ordinated and to establish clearer responsibilities at each level, in some cases the effect has been to destabilise existing relationships that were formed under the old rules and now have to be readjusted to reflect the new rules. This can occur in the middle of multi-year agreements and can affect outcomes. In an assessment of the French system, Reimer et al.\",\"Such policies have also enabled the city to define projects in a much more stringent manner than the regular development process would allow. The city has, for instance, developed high-quality public spaces and amenities as it readies plots for development. Of course, many developments in the city remain private sector led, active land-use policies are only used in some cases.\",\"The duty to co-operate is about good strategic planning based on co-operation. The onus is on the local government preparing the plan to demonstrate effective co-operation -leading to outcomes that are clearly translated into planning policy. Discussions should be started early and carried on as the plan is prepared.\",\"Move from unified and technocratic policies, standards and norms of urban design to more flexible and locally based practices. Urban policies are designed with a top-down approach that is not appropriate for balancing public and private development interests in the economic realities of the market. There is a disjuncture between urban planning and development, because citizens and main local market players are excluded from formulating policy.\",\"In addition to adjusting the targets for public transport, Vietnamese policy makers have two key considerations: how to design effective public transport systems and what options they have available to pay for them. However, there are significant obstacles to urban transport system integration in any comprehensive form. They range from rushed implementation that has produced conflict and confusion, to inadequate technology for secure collection of fares and recognition of tickets, to disparities in equipment and infrastructure maintenance between municipalities (Hidalgo and Carrigan, 2010).\",\"Greenpoint was hit in the late 1950s by a major oil spill of an estimated 17-30 million gallons, predominantly from facilities owned by what is now' Exxon Mobil. Decades of environmental activism by long-term residents and collaboration with more recent, and often wealthier, in-movers, have led to a cleanup process that does not automatically or exclusively lead to the “parks, cafes, and a riverwalk” model of a green city - but instead makes room for continued industrial use and blue-collar work. The core feature of a “just green enough” strategy aims at the existing working-class population and industrial land users, not just new development. Activists in Greenpoint want to achieve the cleanup of Newtow n Creek while maintaining its industrial base, a strategy designed to put a stop to speculative development attracted to a neighbourhood experiencing environmental improvements. Initiatives ranged from the recent declaration of Newtown Creek as a Superfund site, to historical battles against a waste incinerator and a new power plant, to other interventions such as the construction of a local nature trail (Newtown Creek Nature Walk).\",\"Many countries across the OECD, including France, have recently grappled with similar reforms - with the need to reduce complexity and yet forward integrated spatial planning that can address multiple sectoral issues and policies across a functional territory and act in a timely and responsive manner. The new approach in the Netherlands is unique in terms of how it reorients relationships. A critical element of Dutch spatial and land-use planning is that while institutional frameworks (laws, policies, regulations) structure action, they are not the only feature that does so.\",\"The social and economic benefits of urban green spaces are equally important, and should be viewed in the context of global issues such as climate change, as well as other priorities set out in the SDGs, including sustainable cities, public health and nature conservation. Thus, reducing socioeconomic disparities in the availability of urban green spaces can help to reduce inequalities in health related to income, minority status, disability and other socioeconomic and demographic factors.’ Air pollution contributes to rising temperatures and heat wave episodes, leading to increased rates of mortality from heart attacks or stroke as a result of heat stress, particularly in people with pre-existing NCDs.\\\" Parks and green spaces provide people with the opportunity to walk and cycle more often and engage in leisure-time physical activity. Therefore, investments in city parks, green spaces, and waterways are an effective and economical way to both promote health and mitigate climate change. Cities should use this information to make decisions that will promote health, mitigate climate change and enhance the quality of life for residents.\",\"The MRA forms an important platform in this regard with voluntary municipal commitments to a joint spatial vision. The regional transport authority offers another venue for inter-municipal co-operation. These metropolitan governance structures are discussed in Chapter 3. One of the few organisations in place today that can provide such co-ordination is the Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (Osterreichische Raumordungskonferenz, OROK) that assembles representatives from all levels of government to discuss spatial policies. Further, as it is located at the centre of government (within the Office of the Chancellor), it may also be able to carry out the necessary cross-sectoral policy co-ordination between different branches of the national government. Its decision-making body is chaired by the Federal Chancellor and its members include all federal ministers, the heads of all federated states and representatives of associations of local governments.\",\"The diversity of rural areas was acknowledged and strived to foster urban-rural linkages. Such a spatial planning approach requires a macro regional strategy that recognises the importance of a polycentric urban network to the development of areas linked to these metropoles, including small and medium-sized towns located nearby (European Network). This is driven by an understanding that urban-rural interactions should address not just proximity issues (e.g. commuting patterns), but also consider reciprocal exchanges in order to build meaningful partnerships.\",\"Density credits and other incentives for developers, as well as the overhaul of zoning codes help implement these strategies (OECD, 2011). While large cities can produce beneficial effects from agglomeration, population growth can bring with it negative externalities. The continued growth of cities raises transportation costs and leads to increases in land values, higher living costs, labour shortages and environmental degradation. All complicate continued inclusive and sustainable growth.\",\"What is “green” about this growth is how it is stimulated: through urban activities (including policies and programmes) that reduce either: 1) negative environmental externalities, such as air pollution and C02 emissions, or 2) the consumption of natural resources and environmental services, including w'ater, energy and undeveloped land. These effects are in part the result of more readily identifiable interactions at the urban level among economic efficiency and environmental objectives. By focusing on growth, this definition recognises that polices to reduce environmental impact can only be sustained over the long term if they generate wrealth (OECD, 2013).\",\"If it does, the urban growth boundary will be able to accommodate 11 300 additional dwellings without expanding. Refill rates are highest in the central city and lowest in suburban residential neighbourhoods. Most residential refill is multi-family housing, often as part of transit-oriented development (TOD).\",\"For example, the estimated total investment costs necessary to achieve the transport masterplan targets (including road and public transport targets) by 2020 for Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City are about USD 12.7 billion and USD 21 billion respectively (ADB, 2010). Viet Nam is not alone in facing a funding gap when it comes to infrastructure development: according to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the infrastructure funding gap in developing countries can be estimated to between USD 1 and 1.5 trillion (United Nations, 2015). However, considering the clear resource gap, Viet Nam urgently needs to devise complementary funding strategies. One of these mechanisms, as highlighted above, could be to price against negative externalities of car usage, through congestion and parking charges, and redirect this revenue into public transport infrastructure development.\",\"The organisation acquires land or property on behalf of its members (or other public bodies) in order to support local housing policy, economic development, leisure and tourism, establish utilities, reduce\\u002feliminate health hazards, enable urban renewal, and save or enhance heritage site and natural areas. Apart from this long list of actors involved in spatial policy and land use governance there are also commissions to regulate commercial development projects and agricultural land use change, a regional public finance agency to collect taxes, the areas under industrial (SEVESO EU directive) or environmental risks (flooding) are managed by the State and the airport is managed an independent authority. Formal rules require consultation with “associated persons”—this is a list established by law which includes other local authorities, and various Consular Chambers that represent specific groups (e.g. agriculture, commerce and industry, trade).\",\"Metropolitan spatial plans typically aim to provide a medium- to long-term vision for development, which is, however, not always aligned with the timeframe of other plans at municipal or national levels. There is also a risk that such medium- to long-term plans may be considered too long to imply anything meaningful or realistically feasible for short-term political mandates. However, it eventually turned into gated communities (called fraccionamientos), whose development and public sendee provision mainly take place outside the control of public authorities and contribute to increasing socio-economic inequalities within the metropolitan region.\",\"Recently, nongovernmental entities such as social enterprises and community-based actors have been active and playing larger roles in the rural development policies. This framework takes into account the demographic challenges in OECD rural regions and it envisages rural areas as key engines for national prosperity. Delivering improved well-being for rural dwellers (across economic, social and environmental dimensions). Understanding the growth dynamics of low-density economies (distance to markets, role of the tradable sector, and absolute advantages).\",\"In these places, the city that plans has become a reality. There is no shortage of places where planning is practiced as a vanity for national or municipal leadership, where imported ideas of “what will lead to a good city” are recited by planners from their textbooks or in response to the directives of their political leaders, where visions of urban form and urban design are thought to be sufficient to charting the future, where implementation is an afterthought, and where the objective is the planned city. Therefore, as the United Nations embarks on charting the New Urban Agenda, it is important that the discussions recognize the diverse contexts as well as issues and lessons emerging from them.\",\"It can be limited through the development of transportation systems, land use policies that encourage increased density, and the fostering of economic linkages between large and medium-sized cities to create sites of further growth. New zoning rules and the provision of services to address the negative externalities of dense urban development may also be needed. Inter-city transportation systems can help the development of medium-sized cities to attract investment and growth.\",\"They do not stand alone as isolated principles, but are rather informed by several broad-based international agreements and declarations.10 These principles respond to the questions: What is the direction of transformation? How does it connect to the world that we want? The key strategic components are considered as “development enabiers\\\" that can be thought of as frameworks for action in response to the multiple challenges raised by the often chaotic forces of urbanization, and also, at the same time, as frameworks for action to harness the opportunities that the same urbanization brings.\",\"The Regulating Plans were designed to regulate land use, construction and the physical development of urban areas, and the notion of a planning instrument in Chile revolves mostly around these activities. They were not designed to promote more integrated urban development, programming or service delivery. Thus, a management instrument, one from which the land use plans cascade down, becomes essential for ensuring overall coherence.\",\"Using 29 comparable variables from this study, the OECD calculated that Antofagasta’s composite score rose from 21st place in Chile in 2002 to 13th place in 2013 (Figure 4.1). This is a significant step, but Antofagasta’s performance is still spotty. While it rose from near bottom to almost the top ten in health and environment in 2013, it also ranked 50th in connectivity and mobility, whereas in 2002, it was 38th out of the 93 municipalities evaluated.\",\"Urban areas are areas that require systematic development, maintenance, management and conservation of areas where population and industry are or are expected to be dense (Article 6 of the National Land Planning Act). Therefore, the areas that are not systematically developed and dense are non-urban areas, in other words, rural areas. From the agricultural policy perspective, the Framework Act on Agriculture, Rural Community and Food Industry defines “rural community” in line with the act’s objectives.\",\"The sectoral vision is focused on the agricultural sector rather than on the rural territory. A sub-regional perspective in rural policy is recognised in budgetary planning, but a similar recognition does not serve urban-rural project developments. One reason for the sectoral approach at the state level is that federal resources to support state and municipal governments are defined according to sectoral objectives, rather than in a way that could contribute to consolidating strategic development projects in specific rural areas.\",\"The act does, however, specify how the vision is to be implemented - e.g. the tools and instruments to be used, which are the same for all levels of government. Apart from this, governments are free to choose a form that best suits the spatial subjects, the method of work, and their own political and administrative culture. Vertical co-ordination between provinces and municipalities occurs in provincial planning committees that serve as platforms for discussions between all three levels of government.\",\"Lack of clear legislative frameworks can act as one of the major impediments to effective design and implementation of these policies, standing in the way of “positive urbanization.” Cities can adopt essential elements of laws that are grounded in sustainable processes and systems, and move on to more elaborated arrangements and legal instruments as management and governance institutions mature. They must be adapted to any country's and city’s specific needs, resources and capacities and be enacted according to specific circumstances. Since the 1990s, extensive research in many countries on urban regulations such as building codes, zoning, environmental rules, and others suggests that many urban regulations are out of date. Some reflected colonial heritage, others were biased in favour of middle- and upper-income groups, while others still generated perverse economic incentives for private (as opposed to public) investment in housing and other services.26 This goes to show that reform of urban regulations is an important lever for change.\",\"This may be seen as a positive factor, in encouraging urban administrators to be ambitious on behalf of their cities and the provinces they serve, but it also carries certain disadvantages. For example, as the scoring system emphasises infrastructure development and population growth, local infrastructure development is prioritised above adherence to the 2009 Adjustment of Orientation Master Plan to Develop Viet Nam’s Urban System until 2025 with a Vision to 2050 (AOMP) and other urban strategies w'hich place a stronger focus on sustainability. Emphasis on population growth has resulted in municipalities expanding their existing administrative boundaries in order to “catch” neighbouring rural areas and convert them to urban land, so as to add to their population figures.\",\"Finally, it is important to continue building regional-level capacity in planning, ensuring that the links between ERD and PROT are clearly understood and implemented. For example, PROT have not yet substituted Regional Plans for Urban Development (PRDU). As mentioned, only 3 regions have operative PRDU and 11 have a PRDU in the pipeline.\",\"It has developed an online tool that provides a mapping function of a variety of important indicators at the municipal and regional level and releases a report on the state of spatial development every three years. It manages the integration of structural funds into broader spatial strategies and was directly responsible for the programming work related to 1 of the 11 thematic objectives of the programming period 2014-20. They were established (mandated) as part of the Modernisation of territorial public action and affirmation of metropolises law (2014) and are intended to strengthen dialogue between local authorities and the region and to co-ordinate responsibilities. The CTAP in each region are chaired by the President of the Regional Council. Its membership includes representatives of departements and intercommunalities of different sizes.\",\"First, it reviews different configurations of governing transport and spatial planning in OECD metropolitan areas. It then discusses possible institutional arrangements to achieve more effective integration between transport and spatial planning. While there is widespread consensus that better connecting transport and spatial planning decisions helps prevent costly consequences of urban sprawl and promotes harmonious development, institutional barriers remain slow to dismantle and co-ordination mechanisms put in place on an ex post, ad hoc basis may take time to become fully effective. The responsibility for transport planning and spatial planning occasionally lies within the same institution, but more often within different entities, as illustrated in the experience of the different case study regions (Table 2.1).\",\"If they do not, the answer is considered favourable. The Directorate of Planning is the strategic advisory body of the MOP in matters of planning, policy definition and general co-ordination. It is in charge of proposing policies and development plans in such infrastructure as roads, ports and airports, or water resources.\",\"It begins by outlining the complex structures of current national urban policy frameworks. A distinctive element of Viet Nam's approach to urban policy is a heavy emphasis on city classification, and this too will be considered. The chapter will then give attention to key urban policy areas: urban transport, housing, land management and the quality of the urban environment. As highlighted in Chapter 1, Viet Nam has made impressive economic and social achievements and powerful imperative towards immediate economic development carries obvious weight as a public policy goal.\",\"For example, according to national law, natural areas can be developed only if the area is covered by a SCoT. Such incentives have been further strengthened by the requirement that developed areas that are not covered by a SCoT cannot be expanded starting from 1 January 2017 onwards. To encourage the adoption of SCots, the State set up annual calls for proposals starting in 2010 to increase participation in rural territories with limited human and financial resources to draw up SCoTs. The PADD is the policy document which establishes the main thrusts of territorial development for the next 15 to 20 years, the DOO is the technical document which is enforceable against local documents such as the local housing programmes (Programmes locaux de I ’habitat), urban mobility plans (Plans de deplacements urbains), local urban planning plans (Plans locaux d’urbanisme) and municipal maps (Cartes communales).\",\"There is strong pressure to make better use of investments and more efficiently deliver services in rural areas. Integrated investments have the potential to reap the benefits of complementarities when they are adapted to the needs of different types of rural areas. Different sectoral policies should be co-ordinated and mutually reinforcing, and the mix between them should be rebalanced to meet differing local needs.\",\"This said, the national government could, at a minimum, better define the role and relationship of the various planning documents. To improve planning coherence, a clearer definition of the interaction between regional-level strategic and planning instruments (i.e. ERD and PROT) and their municipal level equivalents (i.e. PLADECO and the various Regulating Plans) is needed. This means improving the interaction and co-ordination between regional and municipal authorities, as well as between regional government and line ministries and their SEREMI.\",\"Some OECD countries, such as Canada and the United States, have traditionally restricted regulations on land use, prohibiting mixed land use to avoid the negative externalities of differences in land use. Such zoning still makes sense in many places, although land-use regulations should be better co-ordinated to increase access on foot to local services and jobs. Deregulating zoning and introducing form-based zoning can be a way to revive urban centres, as can establishing mixed-use zones that allow both business and residential uses. This helps to reduce travel time to jobs and services, and to improve access on foot or by public transit for older people.\",\"Chile’s last urban development policy was enacted in 1979, amended in 1985 and then repealed in 2000. These five thematic sub-commissions cover: urban planning, institutionalism, patrimony\\u002f heritage, social cohesion, and sustainability. The inter-ministerial roundtable consists of representatives from the ministries of Public Works, National Assets Environment, Agriculture, Interior, Social Development, Defence, Finance, Economy and Energy.\",\"This is all the more necessary due to the risk of increasing social segregation resulting from peri-urbanisation processes and the up-scaling of strategic planning processes to the metropole scale. However, participatory planning needs to balance local needs and expectations against general planning goals and objectives such a densification which may be contrary to local interest. The two regional parks offer some possibilities as well.\",\"This would enable each city to plan and invest in its urban environment based on its long-term vision, and allow localities to have more control over private developers to ensure that projects contribute to a high-quality urban environment. There must be an explicit recognition of the importance of preservation on existing cultural heritage in Viet Nam. When streets become recognised as public spaces in cities, they can be both planned and designed in a way that increases the quality of life of urban residents and supports more environmentally sustainable and productive cities.\",\"These regions, within the scope of their competence, ensure planning and co-ordination of regional development and co-operation between local government and other parts of the administration. In accordance with the Law on Regional Development, the Riga planning region as an institution is a derived public entity supervised by the Ministry of Regional Development and local government. Its decisionmaking authority is the Riga Planning Region Development Council, whose 18 members are appointed at a meeting of all heads of municipalities in the planning region.\",\"Correspondingly, rural policy has increasingly adopted functional and network-based approaches to deal with rural issues such as basic service provision, along with traditional large-scale investments to build growth hubs. Rural economies require to improve the agricultural productivity, that remains a key rural industry, and increase the economic opportunities and jobs in off-farm and non-agri sectors. To this end, several policy initiatives such as the Smart Agriculture and the 6th industrialisation of agriculture have been in progress by the Agriculture Ministry.\",\"This section discusses each in turn. It is a medium size agglomeration, with a dense core, close suburban belts, and uneasy relations with local governments in a mostly natural or agricultural hinterland, leading to strong competition and tensions with regards to land use and development. Because in France there is little likelihood of amalgamation and all communes have equal rights and authorities, local policies try to tackle these challenges by forming co-operative communal associations and with the SCoT a common spatial plan.\",\"Therefore, the relative use of local building materials and resources in the construction industry has a substantial effect in the way in which the construction industry can be harnessed to enable growth in the local economies of LDCs. The development of local sustainable building materials and technologies may also boost the associated retail and consulting industries. Data on shares of ODA that goes into the construction industry is one of those areas that need setting up of new systems to support data collection and requires establishing new partnerships at the national levels and local authorities' levels.\",\"First, it led to the idea that resources should be concentrated in a small number of locations to achieve critical mass (Parr, 1999: 1198). This idea is extended to include the spatial concentration of specific industries in particular places that are the most suitable for their growth. The second result was the idea that national governments could induce new poles in different parts of the country to achieve more balanced growth—pdles d'equilibre (Parr, 1999: 1203). Actions by die government could move both workers and firms to a new location that would become the motor for regional growth. In France these ideas continue to underpin the process of spatial planning and influence the allocation of responsibilities to different levels of subnational government.\",\"This is the relationship between the SCoT and the PLU\\u002f PLUI (intercommunal and communal), and between the previous SDRIF\\u002fSAR\\u002fPADDUC\\u002fSRADDET and the SCoT (regional and intercommunal). Further, the SCoT must be compatible with landscape protection and improvement directives set out in the national Mountain and Coastal laws. Compatibility requirements are less demanding than are conformity requirements in the sense that conforming requires complete consistency, while compatibility allows significant differences, as long as the general intent of the superior plan is preserved.\",\"The site houses a versatile pavilion, a park, a playground, a sanitation centre with a rainwater-fed water tap, a day care centre and a new bridge. Local residents are involved throughout the project to learn about watershed issues, prepare proposals, and participate in the design process. The programme aims to create sustainable neighbourhoods and promotes a safe environment for children that encourages them to participate in social and educational activities and build a stronger relationship with their community.\",\"Investment Plans included objectives such as public transport efficiency, or promotion of \\\"integrated development\\\" of both housing and residential infrastructure, along with so-called productive investments such as industrial parks or factories. Strategic investment plans acknowledged that the urban area was larger than a project area, that some spaces deserved higher priority than others, and that \\\"strategy\\\" meant making choices in a spatial context. The challenge, therefore, was to determine which rules might encourage behaviour in specific directions and what were the so-called \\\"enabling conditions\\\" required for desired outcomes to be achieved. The difference lay in the assertion that market-oriented policies were intended to affect not only individual entities, both corporate and otherwise, but the whole pattern of behaviour of all entities, both individually and collectively.\",\"Its approach to urban planning is a natural outgrowth of this view. The lesson is clear: where the political interests of national governments are at odds with the objectives and efforts of city authorities, urban development is retarded. Where national governments offer support and autonomy to local authorities, rapid and significant change is possible.\",\"To make the most of cities' growth potential, it is important to facilitate transport links among metropolitan areas and between metros and smaller urban centres. Governments may set targets for cities to fulfil different roles, (e.g. \\\"Innovation Cities\\\", \\\"Enterprise Cities\\\", \\\"Eco-Towns\\\") or increases linkages between metropolitan areas and smaller cities in a greater region (e.g. proposals for the Seine valley axis between Paris and Le Havre). Are cities' incentives aligned with the need to reduce the reliance on automobile transport?\",\"These are important amendments that could reduce regulatory burden and streamline the building approvals process without reducing environmental diligence. As the investment climate in Kigali improved, so too the construction industiy. Combined with forward looking urban planning, focused on working with the community to improve the quality of public spaces and based on disaggregated data collected through tools such as the One Stop Youth Centres, this allowed us to guide urban development in the right direction.\",\"This is followed by an overview of France’s spatial and land use planning system and how it has changed over time. Finally, the purpose and scope of various spatial plans at the different levels of government are elaborated, including a discussion of how they are intended to integrate with each other. But each country implements these tools in its own way and uses its own framework of subnational government to assign different tools and functions to specific levels.\",\"The social mix principle tries to promote a rational distribution of urban public resources and provides adequate housing for different revenue groups through city planning regulations - ensuring social equity and promoting economic efficiency. An affordable and accommodating city is a core feature of a sustainable city. For example, Vietnamese cities are struggling for the provision of open space in dense inner-city centres. In Hanoi, between 2000 and 2010, the area devoted to parks and public gardens per capita went from 2.17m2 to 1.58m2 (HealthBridge, 2015).\",\"Economic planning and physical planning should be co-ordinated. Move from administratively constrained, short-term subsidising policies to co-operative, multi-actor-based long-term investment strategies. This would make it possible to create mobile, resilient and green environments for residential and economic activities, while reducing the costs of development. Nowadays, rural communities adjacent to large cities are excluded from the official procedure of planning and management of urban development. Cities are treated separately from the neighbouring rural and other urban areas. Regional and urban development instruments are not coherent.\",\"But regions remain restricted by the loss of the “general competence clause” and the principle that no government can exert oversight over other governments where it lacks clear jurisdiction. Both France and Austria have established regular conferences that provide such structure, but at different scales and for different topics. France’s Territorial Conferences for Public Action focus on dialogue between regions and local authorities and are open to a range of thematic areas whereas the Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning assembles representatives from all levels of government and is specifically targeted to address spatial planning issues. They were established (mandated) as part of the MAPTAM law (2014) and are intended to strengthen dialogue between local authorities (including EPCI) and the region and to co-ordinate responsibilities.\",\"How the city accommodates its increasing physical development needs will help determine the success of urban green growth. Getting a city right as it urbanises will be dramatically easier and cheaper than fixing things later. The risk of locking in the urban form should be addressed at the centre of urban green growth policy making.\",\"The second order involves regular large (\\u003e 1,000 people), big (500-1,000), medium-sized (100-500) and small (\\u003c 100) rural communities (townships, villages and homesteads). These efforts have resulted in the formation of more than 1,500 agro-towns, based on the selection of and funding support for existing, more or less economically viable, central settlements of rural councils and homesteads of agricultural organizations. Each agro-town enjoys amenities characteristic of an urban settlement, including clubs, a library, an art school for children, internet cafes, entertainment centres, upper secondary and vocational schools, pre-university training centres and primary education schools. Intensive public investment in these settlements in the period 2007-2010 has helped to address some critical problems and develop important social and business processes and infrastructure. This involves a hierarchy of spatial (territorial) plans developed at national, oblast and local levels in accordance with the Main Directions of the State Urban Development Policy for 2011— 2015 and environmental requirements.\",\"Departements implemented national policy at the regional level. The system was hierarchal and top-down. It was a policy that emphasised territorial equality in terms of centralised access to State administration and that led to a high level of control over the territories. Many actions by departements and communes required authorisation by the Minister or even statutory approval by the national legislature.\",\"Immediate action is needed to make Vietnamese roads safer through better regulated motorcycle traffic, address noise and air pollution through promoting the use of e-bikes and e-scooters, and allocate a greater proportion of the real cost of car usage to the owners of the vehicles themselves, particularly through fiscal measures such as congestion and parking charges. Longer-term transport investments should explore such financing means as public-private partnerships and value capture mechanisms. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) initiatives in Ha Noi and elsewhere require specific efforts to harmonise with the principles of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and intermodal connectivity to ensure ridership and maximise the investment benefit. Nonetheless, under the unprecedented urbanisation process, access to affordable and high-quality housing is one of the foremost challenges for Viet Nam’s urban areas.\",\"In recent years, some cities in Belarus have become pioneers in integrating some elements of a green city approach into their urban planning and development practices to address some of the problems they face in a more systematic, integrated way (box 13.3.). Multifamily housing constitutes about 140 million m , or 60 per cent of the total. Private dwellings made up 89.5 per cent of the total housing.\",\"This has to be done with caution, as discouraging construction outside the city limits may have a negative impact on housing affordability in central areas, and land use should guarantee affordable new housing as the population grows. Abandoned and underused parts of the cities deserve to be made the priority for development, and any attempts to develop beyond a city’s boundaries may need to be restricted. The former or partly used industrial sites occupying considerable areas of the cities will have to be in the redevelopment agenda. In the case of single-industry towns, it can be especially important to reuse post-industrial zones and brownfields.\",\"Municipalities can choose the level of control among several different methods. They have the authority to either formulate a plan local d'urbanisme (or PLU, a local uiban plan that includes detailed land-use regulations and sets the zones where construction is permitted) or a carte communale (the municipality map demarcating areas where construction is permitted), depending on the context of the municipality. Construction in green fields is only possible when allowed by the PLU or by the carte communale, and municipalities must otherwise comply with the national principle of limiting construction.\",\"Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, DC.

The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs is responsible for this strategy to develop Vietnamese human resources through the vocational school development project by 2020 (Decision #630 of 2012) and supports these institutions. These initiatives could be strengthened by including jobs and skills related to environmental activities, such as consulting for clean equipment production, environmental impact assessment and research and development focused on technology to improve the port’s environmental performance (see Chapter 3).\",\"Mechanisms for vertical co-ordination on spatial planning (cont.) Beyond the preparation of the Spatial Development Concept, the OREK also monitors spatial development across Austria. It has developed an online tool that provides a mapping function of a variety of important indicators at the municipal and regional level and releases a report on the state of spatial development every three years.\",\"The mere sum of individual municipal decisions in transport and spatial planning rarely shapes up into a coherent metropolitan development plan. Co-ordination efforts by a metropolitan governance body sometimes boil dowm to stitching together individual plans on an ex post basis. Furthermore, municipalities sometimes do not find out about the plans of neighbouring municipalities until it has become complex and politically costly to negotiate adjustments.\",\"However, in the absence of strong public participation it is difficult to claim that the plan has local endorsement or acceptance. Efforts to capture local concerns through the use of mathematical models that assess the impact of changes in transport networks at the local level on agriculture, landscape and housing provide a weak substitute for direct contact with the local population. Most opposition was directed towards the proposal to increase housing density in the urban core and to limit the peri-urbanisation process.\",\"Spatial planning decisions also affect citizens’ quality of life directly, including ease of access to jobs, services and amenities. National and sub-national governments across the OECD are involved to varying degrees in policies pertaining to “place” (e.g. land-use policies and planning, property rights, land development and redevelopment, land registries, urban transport and environmental performance in urban areas). They have at their disposal a range of policy instruments (e.g. regulation, standard-setting, technical assistance).\",\"If the lower level does not comply, it can be forced through directives ordering it to do so. Furthermore, national and provincial governments can directly impose land-use plans on municipalities. Horizontal co-ordination at all three levels of government occurs through the legal requirement to co-ordinate spatially relevant decisions between the responsible public authorities at the respective level of government. There is also inherent flexibility in how the plans are elaborated by each level of government.\",\"In smaller communes where the local government has few resources and limited capabilities the prefet can have a direct role in land use decisions, because they have the resources of the national state to support their decision while local officials have limited analytical capacity. In rural areas this asymmetry in capacity can lead to asymmetries in power. Today these decisions have been devolved to local councils at the commune level.\",\"These were essentially two-dimensional plans aiming at dynamic representations of urban growth and change while in fact they were more frequently static. Master plans explicitly required professionals and the citizenry alike to fit their aspirations and their desired physical forms into the patterns they set out. The plan was the context.\",\"The larger geographic scale at which metropolitan planning is conducted offers a useful lens for a comprehensive vision of the diverse policy streams at play in the functional territory. Throughout the OECD, the focus of spatial planning is increasingly shifting from imposing restrictions towards promoting development - at least in the official rhetoric. In practice, when metropolitan spatial plans do exist, they may still be narrowly framed around physical infrastructure and remain disconnected from regional development plans and\\u002for economic development plans, which sometimes command larger funding (e.g. in the case of EU countries that receive Structural Funds).\",\"They should be located close to housing and create interconnected green corridors, following modern trends in the most advanced cities. Planning more compact streets and concentrating green areas, while maintaining their share of the total land area, strikes a reasonable compromise between compactness and green landscapes. Putting these into operation will complete the transport infrastructure, raising the efficiency of connection hubs. Current legislation provides private property rights to land only in a limited range of cases.\",\"Implementation was often given insufficient attention. Today, the planning process is viewed to be more important, with significant consideration given to data collection, monitoring and evaluation, policy networks, decision-making procedures, as well as other procedural and interim products. Critics have objected that the outcomes of the statute have not been as profound as intended.\",\"Some form of agricultural use, cropland, pastures and permanent crops, covers roughly 60% of the land, while the remaining 35% of land is in forests, other natural environments and water. There is a distinct spatial order with dense metropolises, growing peri-urban zones, and clearly defined villages dotting the predominantly agricultural and natural landscape. While these spatial forms are shaped by their histories, they are also moulded by present practices—the national regulator}' frameworks that guide and structure actions at the regional and local levels, and by economic forces. This introductory chapter describes the institutional frameworks and policies that that shape the spatial planning system and land use practices at the regional and local levels. Complications arise from multiple sources, but one of the largest is the inherent tension within a system of government that involves both, a strong national government that is engaged in virtually all aspects of French society, and a strong tradition of small scale local democracy that has resulted in a plethora of elected local governments, or communes. This leads to situations where national policies impose a series of constraints that can clash with local priorities.\",\"While inter-connection of urban clusters and their linkage to international transport networks is invariably crucial to national economic development, this review will focus more specifically on transport within urban areas, as opposed to inter-urban transport, given the urgent transport challenges observed especially within large urban areas in Viet Nam. Taking a balanced approach to transport development, this policy framework gives attention to transport needs in rural as well as urban areas, while also acknowledging the interdependence of rural and urban transport systems. The 2013 adjustment has given priority to the development of mass transit systems, initially in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, in order to decongest these cities and to improve safety.\",\"Governments at all levels rely on a variety of revenue streams, but local governments in OECD countries are almost always constrained by higher level governments in terms of their ability to raise revenue and what they can spend it on. The relationship between fiscal and planning systems in a country' in turn creates incentives for how land is used (see Box 1.7 for an illustration). Whereas the United Kingdom’s (central) land use planning system is one of the most rigid in the world and its fiscal system is heavily centralised, Switzerland is an extremely decentralised country, with strong political and fiscal powers allocated at local level. Two main features distinguish the British ‘development control’ system from the continental European ‘rule-based zoning’ system. First, development control is highly centralised and imposes stringent land use restrictions to contain uiban growth throughout the country (‘green belts’ that are largely sacrosanct for development for example surround all major urban centres in England). Second, development control is discretionary rather than mle based.\",\"All other green spaces within a settlement’s boundary are defined as “reserved areas” for expansion of the main categories. While some settlements may meet or even exceed the legal norm, many cities lag behind considerably. For example, Gomel Oblast has only two cities with green spaces above the statutory level (Mozyr, 52.7 per cent and Rechitsa, 46.2 per cent) and a substantial number of cities that fall below this norm (e.g. Petrikov, 4.4 per cent, Chechersk, 8.7 per cent, Dobrush, 8.8 per cent, and Gomel, 17.5 per cent). Green spaces in major cities have also come under specific pressure from increased construction, including the curtilages of multifamily houses.\",\"Rural centres of excellence, France France’s rural centres of excellence programme were inspired by the idea of competitive urban clusters. Projects under this program are awarded State funding for economic development projects in rural areas that involve a partnership between local authorities and private firms. This program was created to support the 2005 law on the development of rural areas.\",\"The municipality plays a limited role and has limited capacity to ensure citizens’ needs are met, for example, through a transport system that provides remote communities adequate service, routes that are coherent and well timed throughout the city, ensures that vehicles are well maintained, clean and meet existing emission standards, and establishes affordable fares that can benefit frequent riders, etc. Citizens often make little distinction as to who is responsible for providing the service - they view public service delivery as a local matter and seldom distinguish which level of government is responsible for providing the service, or even if the service provider is a public or private entity. Service provision in Antofagasta is spread across many jurisdictions and entities, and citizens cannot be expected to keep track of the complexity. In addition, municipalities are legally established as autonomous corporations whose purpose is to satisfy the needs of the local community and ensure its participation in the economic, social and cultural progress of the municipal territory (Government of Chile, 1988).\",\"Where rules are violated, the government will take enforcement actions that depend on the severity of the violation. In Amsterdam, it is anticipated that the new legislative and regulatory framework will make it easier to develop and open the possibility to transform plots to new uses and foster innovation and experimentation. The city has already adapted to some of these changes through the recent Crisis and Recovery Act. But the new Environmental Act goes much further. Importantly, it will also open the possibility for local governments to disallow unwanted developments. In the past, such actions would have required that the city purchase development rights to compensate individuals for the loss of those rights.\",\"However, there is great diversity among them, ranging from 10 952 000 in Ile-de-France to 710 000 in Limousin. The central government is represented by a regional prefect in parallel to the elected regional council. Following changes from the Law NOTRe in 2015 which involved new competences for regions, there was a merger from 22 regions to 13 in 2016 (Charbit and Romano, 2017[nj). More specifically, the region’s responsibilities can be described as follows: regional planning, co-ordinating economic development, vocational training, high schools (OECD, 2007, p. 75[isi).\",\"The Regionalverband emphasises its greater closeness to municipalities and better knowledge of details, claiming priority of regional over state planning. A Mediation Committee has been created to consolidate differing views. The Mediation Committee consists of ten members, appointed in equal number by the Regional Assembly and the Regionalverband.\",\"Between 2004 and 2013, all the 63 FUAs of different sizes in Viet Nam grew much faster (at an average annual rate of 4.3%) than the FUAs in OECD countries on average (0.8%). While in OECD countries larger FUAs grew faster than smaller FUAs, Viet Nam showed a different pattern: both the three largest FUAs (Ho Chi Minh City, Ha Noi and Hai Phong, with a population of 1.5 million or more) and smaller FUAs (with a population of less than 200 000) grew faster (5.5% and 4.3%, respectively), compared to medium-sized FUAs. In the case of Viet Nam, it appears the country has seized the opportunity - as its urbanisation process has come together with strong increases in income levels.\",\"A move in this direction by Chile would require strong political support and clear consensus. Housing, urban policy and municipal infrastructure were the responsibility of the Ministry of Infrastructure, which needed to co-ordinate with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration, responsible for public administration matters, including supervision over self-government units (municipalities\\u002fgminns), counties (powiats) and self-government regions (voivodships). In addition, housing, urban policy and municipal infrastructure, as essential elements in urban planning, simultaneously needed to be co-ordinated with national level spatial and regional policy programming housed in the Ministry of Regional Development.\",\"The strategies outlined in the three main planning documents are closely related. It identifies the main objectives for London: a city that meets the challenges of economic and population growth, an internationally competitive and successful city, a city of diverse, strong, secure and accessible neighbourhoods, a city that delights the senses, a city that becomes a world leader in improving the environment, a city where it is easy, safe and convenient for everyone to access jobs, opportunities and facilities. Examples of these policies are: housing densities, which are linked directly to public transport accessibility levels, maximum car parking limits that are also linked to public transport accessibility, minimum cycle parking standards for all different types of land use, requirements for electric charging provision in new developments, construction and servicing management plans.\",\"This means the partnerships have some semblance of recognition, such that they have been entmsted with the responsibility to act. This provides clues to the level or recognition (by other levels of government), its ability to realise objectives (implementation tools) and financial acumen. On the topic of spatial planning, the case of Rennes, France offers a unique approach—it is an inter-municipal structure called the Rennes Metropole with a dedicated revenue source that elaborates a common spatial plan for the territoiy that’s is then binding for local land use plans.\",\"In essence, the system is evolving to be less hierarchal and more flexible in terms of the rules that are imposed, w hile at the same time reorienting the role of governments in spatial development towards the local level and placing a larger onus on private actors to take the lead in new developments. They further argue that the diminishing role of the national government in such areas as landscape quality de facto elevates the importance of EU environmental directives as a determinant of national spatial structure (Zonneveld and Evers, 2014: 69). Thus, there is much consternation surrounding present reforms which stem in large measure from changes both in terms of how' land use is governed and in the role and scope of governmental actors which have accelerated in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis (Heurkins and Hobema, 2014, Kickert, 2015, Waterhout, Othengrafen and Sykes, 2013).\",\"Chapter 2 then focuses on the national urban policy frameworks supporting urban development at the local and regional levels. Chapter 3 focuses on Viet Nam’s endeavour to foster green growth in urban areas. Chapter 4 evaluates Viet Nam’s urban governance architecture and institutions. They are subdivided into district-level administrative units, and further into municipalities.\",\"As a result, densities are declining. Cities that use land more efficiently have far better conditions to provide public goods and basic services (for example, water and sanitation, transport) at a lower cost. Such areas can consume less energy, manage waste better, and are more likely to maximize the benefits of agglomeration.\",\"Compact, mixed-use cities with high quality infrastructure, combined with policy measures that facilitate inclusion of all stakeholders in decision-making processes, along with charging the true social cost of using private motorized vehicles to secure an increased modal share of sustainable modes—are components of sound strategies for achieving of sustainable urban mobility in cities. For example, the improvement of rural accessibility in Viet Nam has been associated with significant poverty reduction (UNECE, 2012). Nevertheless, significant challenges still exist.\",\"While the social and economic prerogatives of the Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) and the spatial focus of the AOMP should work in tandem, in reality, spatial master plans frequently lack considerations for social and economic questions, and investment plans based on SEDS typically do not consider their spatial implications. This lack of co-ordination between sectoral policies manifests itself even simply in the duration of the respective plans. For example, some sectoral master plans and transport plans have a longer duration than the SEDS, and therefore frequently are not reflecting the up-to-date socio-economic policy objectives of the country. The current framework, despite its considerable scope (e.g., laws, plans, strategies and programmes), is not performing as effectively as it should, due to a lack of clear hierarchical alignment among the networks of laws, government decrees and other policy documents.\",\"This includes creating feeding, breeding and sheltering sites in green, grey and blue areas. Establishing parks and gardens is a common tactic, but activities can also include creating green roofs, walls, facades and balconies. But urban biodiversity has become a sustainability indicator and the importance of urban green governance is increasingly apparent.\",\"A lesson from OECD countries such as Sw'eden is that the zoning process should not be too complex or restrictive, as it can have an adverse effect on housing supply and prices. Kazakhstan’s authorities may wish to emulate the experience of New Zealand, whose zoning practices are comprehensive, predictable and easy to implement. Box 2.7 above illustrates the use of municipal planning and zoning as a tool to facilitate the construction permit process.\",\"Definiciones Instrumentos de Planificacion Territorial IPT” (Definitions of Territorial Planning Instruments TPI), MINVU, Santiago, Chile, uiwui.minvu.cl\\u002f opensite_20070427120550.aspx, accessed 13 September 2012.

As such, it does not give granular detail on land-use development- that task falls to plans and planning decisions at the scale of the commune (PLU for instance), but these must align with the principles or fundamental guidelines. Every municipality covered by the same SCoT commits itself to integrated and joint development w'hich can help mediate and settle territorial issues for the whole area.\",\"Green streets have also enhanced pedestrian safety by shortening crossing distances, and are sometimes considered to slow traffic. Neighbours consider them a real asset to the neighbourhood because they provide water quality and habitat benefits and increase property values.

Since 2008, nearly 100 incentive projects have been accepted for an additional 5.6 acres, despite the recession and economic downturn.\",\"The proposed green building certificate, linked with a mandatory building permit, could be a good solution for guiding eco-friendly building plans and should be expanded to the whole BMA. Upgrading informal settlements in Bandung remains a challenge requiring a comprehensive approach for enhancing urban resilience. This tool can anchor other sectoral urban policies. How well such a tool is utilised may determine residents’ access to public services and employment opportunities, energy demands and energy efficiency of the transport sector, and a city’s capacity to adapt to climate change.\",\"Better defining the different types of rural regions in Morelos should help in developing appropriate policy responses to each of their most distinct challenges.

For instance, the land use plans of MONRE and construction plans of the MOC define urban land differently and have different classifications of land, relying on different criteria. The Land Law lists different land use purposes, classifying it between agricultural, non-agricultural and non-used land, while the Law on Urban Planning is concerned with “urban planning land” - it distinguishes civil, non-civil and other lands, with uses classified as residential, public, commercial, service and industrial.\",\"This can be achieved through a range of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures that will need to be included in master plans. Waterproof surfaces within the city can be balanced with permeable ones, since permeable surfaces mitigate extremes in temperature.

Peripheral greenbelts will be vital for maintaining urban resilience to climate change.\",\"It starts w'ith a section on urban and regional development through w'hich metropolitan governance, mobility, spatial planning and environmental policies are reviewed.

The chapter then reviews infrastructure policies designed to enhance accessibility and connectivity.\",\"A RENEWW Zone placed at the outer edge of an existing informal settlement would provide a bridge to an adjacent urban extension. In addition to the housing, transportation and planning provisions, the Agenda includes leveraging and protecting cultural and natural heritage, developing platforms for meaningful participation in decision-making, enhancing disaster risk reduction, promoting environmentally sound waste management, and providing publicly accessible open and green space.\",\"They point to a direction of change, but stop short of suggesting what needs to be changed, how, or in what time frame. The term can mean many things, but foremost in current global and national policy contexts is the recognition that cities require priority high-level attention in national development strategies, both in macro-economic and social policy terms. National Urban Policies contribute to building linkages between human settlements of various sizes and defining the broad parameters within which the transformative power of urbanization is activated and steered. First, not many national government institutions have the expertise and authority to understand the direct and indirect impacts of public policies on cities.\",\"Road improvement may continue to have its place in locations where it can be demonstrated to be socially and environmentally justifiable - and where proper maintenance can be provided - but only in a broader context of other measures. For these reasons, policy recommendations must embrace broader solutions to problems that are long-term by their nature while also attempting to offer short and medium term measures that can assist with increasing the quality of life in Vietnamese cities by making efforts to make transportation safer and greener. First, with road accidents being the second highest cause of death in Viet Nam (Chapter 1), urban road safety is a pressing issue that must be urgently addressed.\",\"While areas at risk of forest fires may be less easy to organise into zones, decisions to extend urban boundary limits would do well to take into account whether this would extend development into zones of fire risk. One important reform would be to increase the flexibility of zoning, in part through conditional planning. Another would be to create greater incentives for infill development and mixed use, both of which are permitted but perhaps not adequately incentivised. Better enabling infill development would also help address concerns about the availability of developable land within urban boundaries.\",\"However, these documents lack a green growth perspective. The first two documents focus on the process rather than the outcomes of urban development, such as the procedures for developing urban masterplans and for obtaining development permits. Green growth is not clearly mentioned in the objectives, and the only links to green growth are policy targets on green spaces, number of trees and environmental impact assessments.\",\"It implies the need for land use zoning that regulates the types of activities that can be accommodated on a given piece of land, as well as the amount of space and building surface devoted to these activities. Land use planning is essentially a responsibility of public authorities. To be effective, land-use planning relies on settlement land information systems that register varied and overlapping tenure rights.\",\"These plans are not necessarily implemented by the GORE, but it is conceivable that Intendentes will try to combine these central-level strategies with the Regional Development Strategies developed by GORE. The central government’s Strategic Regional Plans lack a solid connection to the regional government’s own development strategy, and having been prepared for the four-year presidential term, could run into obstacles associated with the electoral cycle. The responsibility for regional planning was transferred from the Ministry of Planning. While consultative or participatory processes are often included as part of the planning cycle, as in many countries, the robustness of this process has been questioned by actors at various levels in Chile.\",\"Green urban infrastructure planning also may be integrated in territorial development planning to prevent risks related to heat and floods. In reconstructed urban areas, the focus should be on sustainable land management through denser development and modernization of buildings. This can be extended to improvement of water supply, sewerage and heating systems, to save resources.\",\"This complexity and ambiguity leads to delays in project development, as actors cannot decide which one takes precedence, or how to harmonise both classifications (Wilson, 2016). It also creates serious administrative burden for cities’ officials who operationalise land use changes, BOLUCs and LURCs. Following the formal procedures, development projects have to wait for and comply with a series of land use plans at different scales and from different institutions (see Box 2.16).\",\"Lastly, increased environmental challenges, such as intense energy consumption, air quality and water management, require urgent remedies. However, no universal panacea exists, and sectoral approaches are not always effective. Instead, it could be helpful to formulate a solution encompassing diverse urban components that reflect different urban contexts. The lens of “urban form” is one way to approach building an effective package of policies. Such urban forms can include how places are planned, how connections between places are laid out and how people are involved in urban activities (OECD, 2013a).\",\"Protection and Rational Use of the Forest of the Green Zones.

police officer typically requires that a suspected drunk driver undergo a field sobriety test to confirm impairment before a breath test can be administered. The permissible drink drive limit across the United States is high - 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - and well above the 50 milligram limit prescribed in most countries. The legal constraints applicable in the United States do not allow best practice enforcement to be carried out, and high rates of alcohol related road trauma continue.\",\"They have a degree of political autonomy and are administered by elected representatives. The average population of each borough is around 21000, twice as high as in the previous division, which simplifies interactions with the municipal level and enables capacity building in each borough on matters relevant to road safety. While the whole city's transport and street network is planned and managed by the CML, the municipality has delegated maintenance responsibilities to the boroughs. For instance, formal agreements established by the CML with the boroughs of Arroios, Beato, Belem, Benfica and Misericordia has led to the upgrading of almost 150 pedestrian crossings. The CML provided funding, technical guidance and supervision, and the boroughs selected the target crossings, developed the designs and did all the construction, ensuring proper communication and consultation with local stakeholders along the way. At the same time, since 2014 the city has begun addressing its pressing ageing challenges in a comprehensive manner by deploying strategies in a variety of policy areas.\",\"With heterogeneous methods used for the estimation of trips and distances travelled (Annex A and B), extra care should be taken regarding interpretation of differences across cities. On the other hand, they contribute to a significant risk of VRUs, such as pedestrians, being killed in collisions with cars (Scholes et al., Table 1 does not account for that phenomenon and more research in this area is needed.\",\"Moreover, occupant protection can be enhanced by the further development of seat belts and airbags, e.g. through force-limiting features which control the maximum restraining force exerted by the shoulder belt. Other technological advances that are likely to be relevant for older occupants are: Intelligent restraint systems that adjust for lighter, older occupants, dual-stage airbags to minimise airbag impact in moderate crashes, head restraints to minimise soft tissue injury and whiplash injuries to the neck, side airbags to protect head and chest in side collisions, such as crashes when turning left (in right-hand traffic) or right (in left-hand traffic, DfT, 2009). The concept targets older people in Salzburg (60 to 100 years old) who represent approximately 33% of the city’s bus users.\",\"As part of the 2015 Traffic Safety Master Plan established and implemented by the National Police Agency, a system has been developed to allow' for an automatic search of keywords related with road safety (such as ‘\\\"traffic accidents” and “traffic jams”) on social media (such as Twitter and Facebook) and disseminate the information through the urban transport information system (UTIS). In case of necessity, a police motorbike patrol will be dispatched to address the situation rapidly. The police also designated every Monday and Friday as the “day of traffic discipline” and will use cameras to monitor traffic rule violations at main crossroads. This was already the case in large urban areas, but the initiative has now been expanded to the entire country to be conducted on a regular basis. A smart phone application has also been developed in order to allow citizens to record and report situations of traffic law' violations and award prizes to the best reporters.\",\"Having high-profile spokespeople who are independent of police to support the rationale for the enforcement is particularly helpful (OECD\\u002fITF, forthcoming). For example, trauma surgeons w'ho have experience in treating injuries from road accidents are able to speak with compelling authority' about the impact of alcohol, speed and the failure to wear safety belts on people’s lives. The programme features doctors, nurses, emergency workers and health professionals who volunteer their time to educate the young in the hope that their stories can help reduce the incidence of road accidents.\",\"The promotion of Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) as a means to address driver compliance with speed limits could help to deliver a quick and substantial improvement. This could take the form of adoption of an injury reduction target. A set of safety performance indicators should be developed, including on speed compliance and drink-driving and a programme of monitoring and reporting on these indicators should be established.\",\"The response was that the extra cost on a new vehicle was negligible. Road safety management, speed enforcement plus ISA are tools that deliver. Serious consideration should be given to reducing the urban speed limit from 60 to 50 km\\u002fh, accompanied by additional implementation of 30 km\\u002fh speed zones.\",\"Korea has some 20 million drivers and around 260 000 breath tests are conducted every year, which means that only one out of 80 drivers are tested each year, while in New Zealand each driver is tested, on average, at least once a year. Some people are calling for a lower limit. Is there justification for such a move? The expert response was that there were two general movements: to go to a legal level of 0.2 (zero for practical puiposes) or to 0.5 but with lower limits for novice and professional drivers. Consideration could therefore be given to a lower blood alcohol content for these latter categories. One issue is the large proportion of owner -driver-owners who are not subject to company regulations.\",\"A similar picture emerges for fatalities among the elderly - people who are 65 years or older as passengers, drivers or pedestrians. The number of the per 100 000 inhabitant elderly fatalities in road accidents was 3.7 in 2013 in Korea, compared to an OECD average of 1.2. The speed limits in resident areas are often too high to protect pedestrians.\",\"Therefore road safety advocacy and information should focus on informing those fleet operators. In general in this increasing pace of life, many citizens desire to go faster and as discussed earlier often an individual’s appreciation of the risk of speeding and crash risk is not well informed and the collective risk accumulating in society and the resulting speed related crash problems is one of the classic public health dilemmas or disconnects as described earlier by Prof. Kare Rumar. For example in the enforcement of low level speeding by many more people vs a focus on catching the high end speeding motorists who are relatively few.\",\"The courses are based on voluntary participation and contain both theory and practice. Drivers have to pay a fee of about EUR 60 to participate in the course.

The other three key risk factors include drink-driving, insufficient use of seatbelts and insufficient use of child restraints.

A p-value of less than 0.05 indicates a difference that is statistically significant at the 5% level. Korea ranked highest in the elderly traffic fatality rate, w'ith a rate of 3.6 per 100 000 inhabitant elderly traffic fatalities, i.e. fatalities among the over 65 year olds, on average from 2000 and 2013.\",\"Cars engaged in parking can hinder sight distance of other drivers, causing accidents particularly around junctions and crossings in residential areas. However, traffic signal times are not revised properly according to changes in traffic conditions. In general, the initial design of traffic signal timing is not reviewed for long times.\",\"In Korea, there is no systematic procedure to evaluate the impact of safety measures. As an example, it would be very useful to evaluate the impact of black box fitment in vehicles in order to assess whether this should be expanded. Preliminary research found the installation of black boxes by a Korean taxi fleet had achieved a 15% reduction in fatalities, although another review suggested that black box fitment did not secure a change in behaviour.\",\"Portuguese national campaigns have raised awareness among pedestrians of the dangers they face in traffic. For instance, campaigns have promoted the wearing of reflective equipment by older age people when mobile in urban environments. While this can reduce fatality numbers in the short term, it does not address the root causes of road danger, which are the volume and speed of motor vehicle traffic, symptomatic of a car-dependant urban development.\",\"This is a relatively low penalty when compared with practices in other OECD countries: for the same violation in Western Australia, drivers will be issued with a fine of AUD 1 000 (around EUR 720) as well as having 7 points (out of 12) deducted from their driving license. In France, the penalty is a EUR 1 500 fine and the loss of 6 points (out of 12). The effectiveness of such courses is about to be evaluated in the United Kingdom. In Austria, courses take place over four evenings and a psychologist leads group discussions.\",\"Professor Lorraine Mazerolle and her colleagues have demonstrated that when a procedurally just approach is applied, offending motorists are more likely to comply and accept the consequences (Mazerolle et al., Another advantage is an opportunity for other offences to be detected and dealt with - for example vehicle safety or driver licence offences, which are undetectable by automated enforcement. Most drivers and police officers have no difficultly in understanding the risks of travelling at speeds well in excess of the speed limits, however, many do not understand the risks associated with low level speeding. In fact, the prevalence of low level speeding presents a significant road safety risk and has to be addressed by applying strict enforcement thresholds. The New Zealand experience is that most drivers will travel at speeds below the level at which they perceive police will stop them. Therefore, New Zealand Police set clear standards of enforcement tolerance.\",\"For every 100 hospitalised casualties, police reported 115 serious injuries - serious injuries do not always result in hospitalisation. The reporting ratio that was achieved is a more accurate reflection of the true level of serious road trauma. Over the same period, the number of crash casualty hospital admissions was stable, indicating that the actual level of road trauma had not risen, and the significant increase in reported injuries was attributable to improved reporting. Figure 5.1 shows how Otago and Southland police reporting of serious injuries improved between 1997 and 2002.\",\"Western Australia has removed compulsory testing but retains referral by doctors, as well as referral by family or friends, to the licencing authority to withdraw licences on the basis of evidence, including eyesight checks. In Korea, car drivers from 70 years onwards are subject to a driving ability test every five years. Currently, no regulation is in place for commercial car drivers in Korea, however mandatory driving ability tests for bus drivers are being discussed. In Korea many professional drivers are self-employed and as such are not subject to corporate legislation.\",\"Roads with four or more lanes account for 24.9% of the total accident cost for accidents on straight segments of roads and 24.5% of the cost from injuries in accidents on and around crossroads. Accidents on pedestrian crossings incur higher injury-related accident costs on crossings with traffic lights than on those without. Accidents at pedestrian crossings with traffic signals account for 7.2 % of the total injury related cost, while accidents at pedestrian crossings without a signal account for 1.9%. Among the total injury costs from accidents at pedestrian crossings more than 79% arise on wide streets with at least four lanes and 79% of the cost on wide streets with traffic lights.\",\"It should, however, be noted that in Graz (as elsewhere) 80% of injury accidents occur on arterial roads. Recently the principle that most urban roads have mixed uses (vehicle traffic, cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrian activities) has been used to apply traffic calming measures on arterial roads in urban areas. Perhaps the best-know example of a city that has used a variety of calming techniques on urban arterials is Portland, Oregon.\",\"In particular, small measured differences may not be statistically significant, meaning that the sample is too small and the outcome too variable to give us confidence that the measured differences reflect true differences in the populations. Thus, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results.\",\"Issuing an infringement notice or prosecuting an impaired driver should not be regarded as punishing the citizen but protecting the community. It is important for police officers to understand the risks associated with speeding - the impact of low end speeding and the obvious risks of high end speeding - so they can actively enforce speed limits. Understanding when and where crash risk is occurring allows officers to target areas of greatest risk and maximise impact.\",\"The case-vehicles selected in this study were vehicles involved in crashes where at least one person was transported to hospital by ambulance, i.e. accidents involving a serious injury. The resulting prediction of risk by travelling speed is shown in Figure 6.3. Because of the variety of mean speeds observed in the traffic, it was decide to calculate relative risk for the crash-involved vehicles as compared to mean traffic speed.\",\"It is critical to the success of the programme that offenders cannot avoid the penalty and that it is swiftly applied and strictly enforced. A weak system that allows an offender to frustrate the process significantly weakens the deterrence value.

This gap in the regulation of the industry should be closed as quickly as possible. Mandatory driving ability tests for bus drivers are being discussed. Again, these deliberations should be concluded as quickly as possible and regulation introduced.

These behaviour patterns, when observed across a population, are relatively consistent over time. Typically, this results in similar numbers of alcohol related crashes, speed related crashes and a predictable range of crashes occurring. The long term reduction in these trends relies upon a relentless enforcement programme and supporting publicity over many years in order to change engrained behaviours.\",\"Thus important challenges remain to be tackled so that Riga and Latvia can reach their national targets of reducing fatalities by 50% by 2020 (European Commission, 2015). The following sections delve into governance structures of road safety and further explore specific policies and mechanisms that were introduced to improve road safety performance in the city of Riga. It sets out the main principles and governance bodies for the organisation of road traffic and the responsibilities of different administrative levels. It organises and co-ordinates the development and implementation of national policies and monitors compliance with laws and regulations concerning road traffic safety.\",\"Typically speed limits are reduced when traffic builds up towards the critical 2000 vehicle per lane per hour. The aim of the speed limit reduction is to reduce speed variance and the propensity for shock waves to cause incidents and accidents. The overall aim is to maintain throughput, but the schemes typically bring about a reduction in crashes and secondary crashes.\",\"Similarly, driving can be more dangerous than cycling for some demographics (Feleke et al., Longitudinal or even experimental studies would be key to strengthen this observation, which is based on cross-sectional data alone. Nevertheless, this finding suggests that an overall decrease in fatalities is possible in cities planning for a modal shift towards cycling.\",\"In this way, a more exact picture of the developments is formed and the search for explanations is more focused. A past decrease in crashes is no guarantee that crashes will decrease in the future. Only if there is a better understanding of the reasons for the decrease will it be possible to formulate expectations about future developments. There are indicators for (unsafe) traffic behaviour (e.g. speeding, driving while intoxicated), the safety quality of vehicles (e.g. NCAP stars), the safety of roads (e.g. International Road Assessment Program [IRAP] stars) and the quality of the trauma system (e.g. arrival times of ambulances). Analysts can consider to what extent the execution of policies has influenced the SPIs and to what extent a change in SPI has led to a change in the number of casualties.\",\"The years following the creation of the Task Force saw a decrease in deaths caused by road accidents by 29.4% between 2000 and 2003. The Task Force was not only interministerial (with representatives from different ministries and agencies) but also intergovernmental (as it was composed of local officials from Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, Gangwon Province and South Chungcheong Province). It is reasonable to assume that co-ordination at the highest level of the government was instrumental in integrating scattered measures and sending a powerful message throughout the society, leading to major improvements in road safety. The improvement of child safety has been one of the most important successes in the past two decades.\",\"The number of children (age 0-14) killed in traffic was reduced from 1 148 in 1993 to 99 in 2013, representing a 91% improvement, compared to the overall improvement of 57% (ITF Road Safety Annual Report 2015, chapter on Korea, 2015 - data provided by KoROAD). This success followed a decision by the government to designate the improvement of children safety in traffic as one of the nation’s top priorities. This decision was supported by a range of effective safety measures.\",\"Drivers involved in crashes may fail to recognise or acknowledge the effects of fatigue and the symptoms of fatigue may not be evident to police or witnesses at a crash scene. Additionally, crash investigators often do not have a sufficient understanding of fatigue and do not collect the information needed to investigate its possible role. These regulations specify maximum driving hours, work hours, minimum rest periods within a working shift, minimum rest breaks between shifts and maximum hours of work over a week.\",\"This unit would be charged with leading development of a coordinated strategy for delivering the improvements targeted and ensuring the resources made available by government for implementing agreed measures are sufficient to achieve the results expected. Western Australia's Office of Road Safety provides a good example of this kind of lead agency for road safety (the Office was reorganised and renamed the Road Safety Commission in July 2015). This highlights the need for urgent and significant action using the holistic, safe system approach to effectively manage speeds and infrastructure improvements to protect pedestrians and cyclists, particularly in locations where there is high crash risk. The importance of enforcement is clearly understood and given priority in Korea but in many cases it seems that the intensity of enforcement effort and resources allocated to enforcement do not reach the critical level needed to realise the full potential of measures adopted. In particular, it is strongly recommended to make seatbelt wearing compulsory in rear seats on the whole road network (not only on motorways as is currently the case). The lack of regulation and enforcement of professional (in particular self-employed) drivers’ hours of service needs urgent attention.\",\"Moreover, policy makers and road safety experts have to understand that they have great opportunities to win when they operate together with other important areas such as traffic management and environmental policy. Measuring progress can be done by means of information that is collected every day, every week, every month, every quarter, every year or at a longer interval. Monitoring can establish whether developments are still on track compared to a policy goal, and monitoring can establish whether new and undesirable developments have surfaced. The sooner we axe aware of such developments, the better we can prepare suitable countermeasures.\",\"The assumption can be made that car occupants will use their seatbelts (of course, encouragement and enforcement will be needed to achieve this). In many cities in Europe it is now the norm to have 30 km\\u002fh speed limits on residential roads, but it is still common to have the speed limit on urban arterials set to 50 km\\u002fh. Serious and fatal accidents with pedestrians tend to occur precisely on those urban arterials. Yet these roads also have intersections where serious and fatal crashes are often concentrated.\",\"Consideration for vulnerable users is evident in various initiatives, such as the creation of 144 protected zones for the elderly and children with unmanned camera surveillance, expansion of low-floor buses, on-demand taxi services for wheelchair users and obstacle-free pedestrian environments (braille blocks, elimination of bollards and raised spots). A specific initiative for women is the “Road Manager” programme. The sendee runs from 10 pm to 1 am to accompany women residing in obscure and deserted areas from the bus stop to the front door. This initiative is operated in co-operation with the local university students specialising in bodyguarding and safety. For example, the Good Governance Committee, which was established in 2011, brings together elected politicians, experts and citizens.\",\"Until the 1920s or 1930s, they assumed the police were there to protect them and their property from the ‘riff-raff and became angered when the police treated them as perpetrators when it came to traffic offences (Setright, 2003). He argues that the relationship never quite recovered and the vociferous attacks on speed cameras in the United Kingdom and the constraints on their use suggest there is merit in this argument. Having high profile, educated, supportive spokespeople available that are independent of police to support the rationale for the enforcement is particularly helpful.\",\"This user group also causes a number of fatalities among other VRUs. At the other end of the spectrum, buses are the safest way of travelling along the road network. This should be nuanced, however, by observation of the lower number of fatalities per unit of population in those cities where people cycle the most.\",\"Among pedestrians, elderly fatalities are overrepresented and Korea has the highest elderly fatality rate among OECD countries. However, Korea records one of the highest total fatality rates when the elderly are excluded, which indicates that elderly fatalities are not the only safety concern. This data allows an analysis of country level determinants of traffic fatalities. Multivariate regression analysis shows that the per capita number of vehicles active on a country’s roads significantly increases per capita traffic fatalities, whereas the percentage of drivers and passengers wearing seatbelts significantly reduces this figure.14 The protection afforded to passengers by seatbelts is widely recognized and most countries have law's that make it mandatory to wear a seatbelt. Such a modal shift requires the creation of compact mixed-use communities that offer alternatives to car use, such as w'alking, cycling and high quality public transport. “ People first” shifts the focus from the pre-2000s transport policy aimed at traffic efficiency towards comfortable and convenient (public) transport.\",\"First, the time pedestrians are given to cross the street has been calculated not with their real needs in mind (especially for the elderly) but considering the needs of moving cars. Second, at many intersections, turning on red has been allowed (i.e. cars can turn into an intersecting street and go over a crosswalk when it is green for pedestrians). Both decisions can make crosswalks more dangerous for pedestrians, especially those who walk more slowly or have vision problems. Green time for pedestrians remained the same, but it was enough for the smaller distance.\",\"The Police Authority of Gyeonggi Province took the initiative to set up a safety committee together with the education community (Provincial Education Board), citizen associations and the media. The objective of this collaborative structure is to promote road safety control by-analysing the areas where there is a high concentration of accidents, upgrading infrastructure (Province and Regional Office of Construction Management), educating citizens and raising awareness. The committee was elected after a debate that brought together around 150 experts and representatives from the civil society.\",\"However, the initiative has proved so successful that since early 2012, Car Free Days have been held every Sunday in all five of Jakarta's municipalities. Vehicles were required to possess paper based permits to enter the 32 km2 zone, with exceptions made for public transport, public taxis, emergency, diplomatic and military vehicles. However, difficulties in enforcement meant that as much as 35 per cent of vehicles entering the zone were unauthorized, with only 2 per cent caught and fined by police. To address these enforcement issues, and coupled with improvements to public transport services, the city developed an enforcement system based on automated number plate recognition cameras positioned at each of the 104 road entrances to the restricted zone. The system automatically identifies vehicle registration numbers that have not paid for an annual, weekly or daily pass and subsequently sends out violation notices. By comparison a single ticket on the Tehran BRT ranges from 1,500-2,500 rial (S$0.10 to 0.20).\",\"A shift from driving a car to unprotected modes of transport can - and probably will - be the effect of these measures which might be detrimental for older persons, as using these modes tends to be far more dangerous for them than driving a car (Hakamies-Blomqvist et al. Practice in European countries on the licensing of older drivers varies greatly. Some countries require renewal of the driving license at a certain age, whereas others do not. Those countries that do often require some sort of medical examination (Table 7.3).\",\"At a pedestrian crossing with pedestrian traffic light, 2, At a pedestrian crossing without pedestrian traffic light, 3.

Driving should be facilitated for citizens as long as possible subject to their physical ability to drive safely. In the absence of specific impairment licensing should not be limited by age.\",\"Understanding why risks are higher or lower is a basis to attach priorities to problems. The title clearly reflects Korea’s ambition to reduce the number of road deaths. This means there is a target. Deciding on a realistic and ambitious timeframe within which this halving should be realized is a key component of target setting. Experiences in other countries teach us that a halving within 10 years is possible but may also be ambitious. Halving the deaths with a 30 year target cannot be considered ambitious.\",\"Differences can partly be explained with differences in income, residential location, etc., Ethnicity should be integrated in national travel surveys in order to gain more knowledge in this regard. More in-depth research on cultural effects on mobility behaviour is needed to explain possible differences. However, older people’s leisure activities or general mobility increase with decreasing household size when age is controlled for, i.e. the consequences are more negative for older people.\",\"One method to induce a sensation of travelling at high speed is through the use of so called “psychological traffic calming” where road features and markings are used to create a heightened awareness of the need to slow down and\\u002for of entry into a lower speed zone. An example of an entry treatment is the now widely used installation of a “gateway” at village or town entry as shown in Figure 6.5. One example is the study of Jamson et al. ( A major criterion used in the testing was the durability of the effect, i.e. a demonstration that it would work on repeated experience rather than wearing off after the initial encounter.\",\"These deaths mainly resulted from people drink-driving, driving at excessive speed and not wearing their safety belts. Other driving errors such as not giving way, not stopping and not keeping left were also a contributing factor. Estimates of the total cost of the road death tragedy to New Zealand society was around NZD 3.6 billion (Ministry of Transport, New Zealand, 2006).\",\"The surface pedestrian crossing model includes requirements and standards in terms of visibility, drainage, lighting, pavement, road signs, traffic timing and other factors. For instance, for traffic crossings, there is a requirement that the green crossing signal be open for sufficient time to allow the whole track to be crossed at a speed of 0.4 m\\u002fs. To facilitate the crossing of the visually impaired, the model requires traffic lights to be equipped with mechanisms that emit sounds and vibrate.\",\"Before the speed cameras were put in, road signs informed drivers about permitted driving speed and the coming installation of the cameras. A CSDD representative said that while fixed speed cameras were important to road safety, portable speed cameras were also essential, along with public education and infrastructure upgrades. Thus, aside from stationary speed cameras, Latvian State Police still use mobile speed cameras procured in 2008.\",\"However, as already mentioned above, there is no evidence that age-based screening or assessment programmes produce any safety benefits. Hakamies-Blomqvist et al. ( They found no reduction in crashes among car drivers in Finland, but there was a higher rate of fatalities among unprotected older road users than in Sweden.\",\"The driver is given a defined period to fix the fault, forward evidence that the fault is corrected within 14 days, and the police will waive the fine. Similarly, an unlicensed driver who is issued a NZD 400 instant fine and is forbidden to drive is given the opportunity to commence the driving licence testing process. When evidence is presented to police, the fine is waived.\",\"Victoria in Australia has just conducted a trial with recidivist speeders that combined a course with installing a voluntary ISA system on the vehicle. Results will be available shortly. The review should focus upon legislation and penalties (fines, driver demerit schemes) relating to alcohol impaired driving, speed offending, failure to wear safety belts\\u002futilise child restraints, commercial vehicle safety standards and permissible maximum driving hours. Walking is generally the most common mode of transport for the elderly and particularly for the very old although they tend to accumulate less mileage than other age groups.\",\"Instead, it is best to distribute ownership across all relevant departments. In the Lisbon municipality, pedestrian accessibility design templates were adopted and implemented by a range of departments, such as Public Space, Public Works and Local Intervention. These models cover all factors related to physical accessibility, such as relation to nearby public transport stops, drainage, lighting, signal timings and type of pavement.\",\"Additional stakeholder interviews and desk research were conducted to outline the role of specific policies and governance frameworks, to highlight practical solutions and to make recommendations for improving urban road safety. Yet counting fatalities may not tell the full story of a city's road safety performance. In addition, fatalities are challenging to analyse statistically because of the relatively small numbers at the municipal level.\",\"To establish the biggest problems we analyse existing databases with crash data and establish which problems occur most frequently. For example, it could be the many casualties among car occupants or among pedestrians in case of truck collisions. However, we might decide not to consider absolute casualty numbers but to compare the number of casualties to the distance travelled by specific groups, to establish the traffic risk. Then it may turn out, for instance, that young and novice drivers run a relatively high risk. We might also decide not to analyse a specific period but to consider trends over time. The risks for motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians in the UK are much higher than in both other countries.\",\"This report presents the input papers prepared for the roundtable meeting by international road safety leaders, the summary of discussions and key messages and recommendations to the attention of Korean stakeholders. It was also less than that for Sweden and the UK, which have already achieved the lowest rates of fatalities per head of population. The reduction in road fatalities in recent years has been greatest for vehicle occupants, now overtaken by pedestrian fatalities as the largest category of people killed annually.\",\"The Safer City Streets initiative has brought together road safety experts working in cities since its launch at the UN Habitat III conference in 2016. The scope of the initiative includes data collection, with the development and maintenance of a city-level database on mobility and road safety statistics. This work also benefits from the guidance and support of the ITF's International Traffic Safety Data and Analysis Group (IRTAD), who organised the pilot stage and established the methodological framework.\",\"For example, traffic fatalities increased by 59% in 1988, the year of the Seoul Olympics. It was also the year with the largest increase in the ownership of passenger vehicles and considered an impetus for economic progress.7 Similarly large fluctuations coincide with the 1997 financial crisis that affected Korea and many other East Asian countries. In the run-up of the crisis, the traffic fatality growth rate increased by 22% in 1996, followed by a 9% decline in the growth rate in 1997.\",\"It is strongly recommended to make it mandatory to wear rear seatbelts on the whole road network. This measure should be accompanied by strong communication and enforcement activities. Although there is no literature to scientifically link the deterrence effect with the exact amount of the fine, it was felt that the levels of fines in Korea could be too low. As an example, the current penalty in Korea for very excessive speeding (i.e., for driving 60 km\\u002fh above the limit) is a fine of KRW 130 000 (around EUR 100).\",\"This is the concept of risk and is computed as the number of fatalities among a given road user group, divided by the total distance or total number of trips travelled by this group over a given period. Some would argue that time is a more appropriate choice, especially when comparisons are made across modes. Others, constrained by a lack of data, use trips as the denominator.\",\"Increased safety will reduce injuries, deaths and economic losses from traffic accidents and increase usability of public means of transport by the most marginalized groups such as women, children, and persons with disabilities. It will also increase the safety of those working in the transport sector. Connecting marginalized communities such as the urban poor to efficient public transport will significantly increase their access to opportunities, and in turn enhance their connectivity with the rest of the city.\",\"It highlights that in order to develop a successful programme, understanding primary crash patterns and causes allows enforcement to be targeted to proven crash risk and hence maximise its impact. Key considerations include solid legislation that supports the sanctions imposed upon offending drivers, sound intelligence, and well trained, educated and committed police officers.

It is part of the regional safety' index, which is provided by the Korea Road Traffic Authority' (KoROAD) and forms the basis for overall regional traffic safety policies. The high density of cars might explain, to a certain degree, why Korea has a high number of traffic fatalities, even though there are relatively fewer cars in the country.\",\"When collecting further data from cities, the ITF will propose collecting travel durations in addition to distances. For a given user group, it is now possible to compute the total number of fatalities in crashes involving this given user group. In Bogota, Paris City and Inner London, the total number of vulnerable road users killed in collisions with cars is four to seven times higher than the number of car occupants killed in traffic.\",\"Over the years, much effort has been put into finding the relationship between (major) traffic violations and the chance of a crash. And although the relationships vary between crash rates and various types of violations like speeding, driving while intoxicated, ignoring red traffic lights, etc., In order to prove that violations have contributed to crashes, it should be established that those violations have contributed to the occurrence of crashes (causal relation).\",\"Black boxes were initially mounted to reduce dispute over crashes, but they have proved useful to encourage safer driving of commercial vehicles. By 2012, more than 2 million cars, mainly in business fleets, were equipped with this device. Currently car insurance companies reduce insurance premiums by 3% to 5% when black boxes are installed.\",\"The most successful treatment for a rural bend is shown in Figure 6.6, it produced a reduction in mean speed at curve entry of 3.4 km\\u002fh as compared with no treatment. The countdown signs that were the most effective treatment for the approach to village entry, with a speed reduction of 4.7 km\\u002fh as compared with no treatment, are shown in Figure 6.7. The most effective solution for rural straight sections was very similar to the 2-1 concept. These speed reductions are highly significant in safety terms. However, a real-world evaluation to substantiate that the selected treatments worked in the real word has not so far been earned out.\",\"Examples are long acceleration lanes on motorways and large stopping sight distances at intersections, increased letter-height and retro-reflectivity of street name signs, etc. For intersections with traffic lights, errors in giving way and any resulting crashes can be prevented by a regulation that does not allow traffic that can collide to have green light simultaneously. Roundabouts have the required qualities for older drivers: e.g., left turns are eliminated, fewer decisions have to be made because of one-way traffic and yield-at-enter, lower speeds allow for more time to decide and act (Staplin et al., They reduce crash numbers and, as a result of lower speeds, crash severity.\",\"Consolidated 2017 figures in Bogota suggest that that while 19 private car occupants were killed in traffic crashes, 133 (seven times more) VRUs were killed in crashes involving a private car. On the other hand, in a year when 59 cyclists were killed, only three pedestrians were killed in collisions with pedal cycles. This illustrates the significant impact of one road user group on others, relatively modest in the case of pedal cycles, yet overwhelming in the case of private cars. Taxis are clearly separated in the collision statistics, which is something other governments could learn from.\",\"Even when trying to prevent a crash, they make errors. In the case of a crash, we don’t ask who is to blame, but instead we ask “how could this crash have occurred?” This new approach fits better with our understanding of the majority of crashes, in which the ordinary behaviour of ordinary people is involved, rather than criminal behaviour by a small number of offenders.\",\"J. and Trumper, H.

However, of these, four countries brought down the death rates from their previous levels in 2007. For the other ten countries, the death rate increased further over this period.\",\"Notably, to achieve long-term goals for delivering safe and sustainable urban environments, a coherent narrative based on integrated transport and land-use policies needs be developed. The main lessons that can be drawn from the road safety stories of Lisbon and Riga and provides recommendations on advancing good governance for delivering effective road safety policies are mentioned below. Both case studies show the considerable importance of politics and a capacity for successful creation and implementation of road safety policies. Successful implementation requires not just the political momentum to initiate policies to promote road safety, but also the enforcement of legislation in practice.\",\"This was statistically significant both before and after adjusting for various confounding variables (age, number of miles driven annually, etc.). However, drivers of 75 and more who had taken the refresher course were at the same risk as drivers who had not. The same tendency, although weaker and non-significant, was found for single-vehicle accidents. It seems that the refresher course has a beneficial effect on safe mobility only if the driver completes the course before 75. One practice used in Switzerland is described as a representative example, there.\",\"This is more than the OECD average (22.6%). The number of elderly fatalities per 100 000 people has been reported at 30.5, and this is more than 3 times compared to the OECD average of 10.0. In literature 65 years or older is often chosen to be the age limit for being an “older citizen”, or “senior citizen” or “old”, or “elderly” (Amann et al.\",\"The number of speed cameras installed each year is decided by the Ministry of Transport and based on available financial resources. By the end of 2018 the ministry expects to have installed 100 fixed cameras across Latvia. There are plans to install even more speed cameras in the coming years and to also use average speed cameras. The selection of camera location is the responsibility of the CSDD, with input from Latvian State Police, LSR and municipal administrations.\",\"The monitoring of behaviour, perceptions and attitudes among city dwellers could also add value. It seems natural, however, to focus on casualties as the measurable outcome which matters the most to people. This material should be used to support a more vigorous approach to road safety management, with a goal of closing the gap and matching the best-performing cities. It should also be noted that no single indicator could capture all aspects of performance: a city may perform well on some aspects and poorly on others.\",\"While ‘driving’ time is self-explanatory, ‘on duty’ time is all time from when a driver begins work or is required to be in readiness for work until a driver is relived from all responsibilities for performing work. As examples, it includes time such as loading and unloading, completing paperwork, picking up and dropping off or attending to needs of passengers etc. Regulation typically requires commercial drivers to maintain log books that record their driving and on-duty time with strict penalties for failure to accurately complete these requirements.\",\"The car is becoming more dominant as a transport mode for older people, but there are differences among countries, especially between Europe and the United States. In Europe, walking is still an important transport mode for older people, with 30-50% of older people’s trips made on foot (~80% of trips of persons over 80 in the Austrian study are made on foot, see Bell et al. There are differences even within countries, town planning and access to public transport have the potential to influence mode choice in the direction of less dependence on the car (Mollenkopf et al.\",\"Vehicle to person: other (passenger in a bus, person walking inside a bus terminal etc.), Collision between vehicles driving straight in the same direction in the same lane, 7.

Collision between vehicles driving straight in the opposite direction, 10.\",\"In order to get an idea of the minor injuries, one might make inquiries at emergency services departments and at GPs. Whether this is a realistic option primarily depends on which data bases related to public health are available in a country. This issue could be resolved by investment in technology if police organizations would fill out Geographic Information System location data electronically from their vehicles or computers and stop filling out their registration forms by hand.\",\"The device also requires breath samples to be provided at random intervals to ensure that the driver has not consumed alcohol. Such devices have proven to be highly effective (Terer K., and R.Brown, 2014). Points can also be allocated in conjunction with a court disqualification where the court chooses to disqualify a person for less than six months. Demerit points remain active on a licence record for a period of two years from the date of the offence. If 100 or more demerit points are accumulated within any two year period, a licence will be suspended for a period of three months. The suspension period begins as soon as the demerit suspension notice is served on the driver by the Transport Agency or the Police.\",\"Providing safe transport system is an objective for sustainable transport, because risk of injuries and deaths from traffic crashes has become a major public health concern worldwide (WHO, 2011)1' At the same time safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users also has an impact on the choice of these modes. Risk to pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users can be reduced by appropriate street designs and neighbourhood environment. Safer pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure results in increased use of these environment friendly modes (Tiwari & Jain, 2012)2.\",\"The report highlighted the high rate of speed involvement in fatal collisions and the fact that speeding is a widespread problem. Furthermore, the level of enforcement was assessed by looking at the number of speeding tickets issued per 1 000 population. Offence detection rates are highest in the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland where safety cameras are used extensively.\",\"Earmarked resources, wherever possible, can assist the transparency of road safety investment and its value. Revenue sources for road funds typically come from fuel taxes, vehicle registration and licensing fees, and road user charges for heavy vehicles. For example, in the New Zealand Road Safety to 2010 strategy, the road fund finances the national road safety enforcement programme, national road safety education, national publicity and awareness campaigns, national strategy management and coordination processes, national and local low-cost safety engineering measures, and general road network investments that contribute to improved road safety outcomes. User fees are usually collected on a cost-recovery basis and may represent a substantial proportion of a country’s total road safety investment.\",\"An MTA that covers the entire commuting area can co-ordinate among jurisdictions at all territorial levels and reduce negative consequences of urban sprawl. Fatal crashes between road users remain a common occurrence on city streets, whilst they have almost been eliminated in rail or air transport. A growing number of local governments are embracing Vision Zero: a vision of no one being killed or seriously injured in urban traffic to rectify this. In support of such ambitious targets, this report investigates key road safety questions in the context of selected cities in Europe and beyond.\",\"For accidents at crossroads, two types of accidents stand out: collisions between motorised vehicles directly on the crossroad (22.5% of total accident costs) and accidents involving pedestrians and motorised vehicles in the vicinity of crossroads (5.6%). Accidents involving collisions between cars and jaywalkers, who cross the road on straight segments without pedestrian crossings account for the highest cost among pedestrian accidents (8.0%). Accidents involving pedestrians and motorised vehicles also create high costs at pedestrian crossings (5.0%).\",\"For example, if police in a particular location are rigorously enforcing the use of restraints, restraint wearing rates will rise. Conversely, a lack of enforcement will typically see poor wearing rates. Intermediate outcome measures also include independently conducted public surveys that will test the perceived likelihood of being caught speeding, belief that an individual can predict where a compulsory breath testing checkpoint will be and admissions of drink driving. These survey measures provide valuable feedback to police on how effective their operations are in changing public attitudes and behaviours that cause or worsen road trauma. It is important to compare offence detection rates with known offending rates. As enforcement of given offence types rise, actual offending rates will fall.\",\"Models have been developed and made available online for pedestrian crossings, bus stops, pavements and traffic calming measures. Tried and tested design solutions are integrated in a template for Tendering Pedestrian Accessibility and Safety Construction. For instance, crossings are divided into categories such as \\\"uneven crossings\\\", \\\"crossings with traffic lights\\\" and \\\"pedestrian crossings\\\". For each type of crossing, specific accessibility standards and requirements were developed.\",\"Implementation in practice is hindered by fragmented distribution of powers and funds. The initiative led by the then Ministry of Security and Public Administration (restructured in 2014) aimed at increasing traffic safety and especially at reducing fatalities. A study, jointly conducted by the Ministry and the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI), found significant improvements in traffic safety. The study measured the number of people that were injured or died in accidents both before and after the installation of the roundabouts. Compared to the year before the installation, fatalities and severe injures dropped by more than 50% (Table 2.4). The installation of the 192 roundabouts meant that 4 lives were saved and 78 serious injuries - injuries requiring more than three weeks of hospitalisation - were prevented.\",\"Both cases show that strong leadership is needed to incentivise and co-ordinate the actions of stakeholders, including ministries, local authorities, road agencies, parliamentarians, politicians and civil society. The case of Lisbon showed the importance of integrating road safety into wider societal policies and avoiding the tendency towards \\\"silo thinking\\\" that happens in many countries. There is much to gain in addressing road safety and environmental concerns together, as the fights against road crashes and pollution have many common levers. In the case of Lisbon, particular emphasis has been put on physical accessibility and the quality of the pedestrian environment, due to the wider demographic challenges of an ageing population.\",\"Some private professionals can participate in the committee according Transport Safety Act. In practice, the committee does not convene often. Attempts have been made to create such a body. In 2000-2002, the prime minister created a Safety Management and Improvement Committee responsible for co-ordinating safety policies and measures among various governmental agencies.\",\"Korea would benefit from benchmarking with countries presenting similar traffic and population patterns. The Safe System approach, therefore, aims at eliminating serious injuries as well as road fatalities. For the OECD overall, fatalities have gone down faster than injuries, and it is useful to understand the reasons behind this lag.\",\"The Bilforer 65+ (Driver 65+) refresher course system was introduced in the Norwegian Road and Traffic Plan 1998-2007, and was implemented in the 2006 National Plan of Action for Traffic Safety on the Road. Courses are open for all Norwegians from 60 years on and are run by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration in collaboration with authorised driving schools. A course invitation is sent to all drivers aged 65 or more holding a licence and is repeated for those reaching 70.\",\"It was written to provide inspiration and good points of departure that may lead to improvements of the Korean road safety data system, the analysis of data and its use in policymaking and research. One hundred years later, this is still true. Another phrase very relevant for this research is: “You can't manage what you can't measure ”. It is advisable to consider these different sources as part of one road safety whole and clearly agree on who collects which data, with what frequency, and how data is managed and made available to users.\",\"It is therefore difficult to identify an exhaustive budget for road safety in Korea. A substantial amount is for management of traffic operation facilities including traffic signals, speed enforcement cameras, and other safety measures. This budget includes the operating cost of the Korea Transportation Safety Authority (KoTSA).\",\"Speeds are enforced with automatic enforcement (video-based time over distance cameras in the more recent schemes). The use of the hard shoulder for through traffic at times of high congestion is a common feature. The aim of ISA is to discourage or even prevent speeding, by informing drivers about the speed limit for a road, warning them about excess speed and in the most sophisticated systems preventing speeding by use of an electronic speed limiter. The fundamental distinction in ISA is between advisory (warning) systems, which typically beep at the driver when speeding over a certain threshold is detected, and intervening systems, which typically limit speed at, or just over, the speed limit.\",\"Ten questions allow the reader to self-assess driving performance in difficult situations (intersections, dense traffic and reversing), incidents of failing to see other road users, experience of fatigue and vision problems when driving, slowing of reactions in critical situations, and negative feedback from the driver’s friends and family, or from other road users. Respondents are recommended to see a doctor if they experience any of the listed problems, and to undergo a detailed assessment of their fitness to drive. As for most self-assessment tools, no scientific evaluation is available. However, one main result of the EU-Project SIZE was that a most important barrier for agreeable outdoor mobility of older persons stems from difficult interaction with (other) car drivers.\",\"The priority of road safety is still very low for most local governments. People wish to spend taxes to promote income rather than to promote safety. This is getting worse for local governments that are heavily dependent on subsidies from central government. This helps reduce criminal records, but it may not encourage careful driving.\",\"Table 4 summarises the causes of road crashes in Riga between 2014 and 2017. According to estimates, the most severe crashes in Riga involve the most vulnerable of road users - pedestrians. This reduction is due to implementation of a variety of measures, such as use of speed cameras, systematic auditing of road infrastructure, road safety campaigns and development of cycling infrastructure. Nevertheless, since 2011 road mortality rates have stagnated.\",\"An increasing number of countries, including those of the European Union, formulate targets for reducing serious injuries. First, an absolute number is easier to communicate and will be clear to everyone: 1 000 road deaths less per year. A target expressed in terms of ratio is more difficult to explain (Box 4.3). For example, deaths per kilometre travelled may drop while the overall number of road deaths increases.\",\"This target is aligned with the European objective of halving the number of people killed in 2020 and it will be reviewed in 2015. The safety performance indicators established by Spain are shown later in this paper under monitoring. The elderly (people aged above 65) represent more than half of total fatalities. The 9th National Traffic Safety Programme covering the period 2011-2020 was launched by the Government of Japan in April 2001.\",\"In Sweden, the government engaged fully in the promotion of the Vision Zero road safety concept, which was introduced as early as 1972 by the Swedish Parliament. Two examples illustrate this point, as emphasised by research from the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI, 2013): the creation of an interministerial task force for safety under the prime minister and the reduction of child fatalities. Upon presidential instruction, the Task Force was set up under the Office for Government Policy Co-ordination and formulated a key document entitled “Comprehensive Safety Management Policies (100 Tasks)”, which took stock of safety management activities scattered across 13 ministries and 70 laws at that point.\",\"This raises some issues in Korea as injuries are not systematically reported, since injury crashes are often settled between the participants. The response was that underreporting should be addressed by the linking of data sources, in particular by linking police data and health data. Getting access to health data is necessary to better estimate the number of casualties and better understand the impact of crashes on the severity of injuries.\",\"Korea needs to work out its own mix of solutions adapted to its situation and culture. A Korean approach, with public support, needs to be developed. What the Safe System approach will deliver is new energy. The approach should be stepwise, with realistic interim targets to short\\u002fmedium term deadlines complementing the ambitious long term vision.\",\"With the dynamic limit of 80 km\\u002fh, there was a further reduction of 3.4 km\\u002fh. In those situations when the lower limit was accompanied by the slippery road warning sign, the prevailing weather and road surface conditions reduced traffic speeds by 9.3 km\\u002fh with the combination of lower limit and slippery road warning bringing about a further reduction of 1.8 km\\u002fh. There was also an effect that the signs reduced speeds on adjacent road sections.\",\"Road safety performance or road safety capacity reviews as they are known have been conducted in a number of countries. This is discussed with some examples in the “Getting Started” section at the end of this report. Between 2000 and 2012, the number of fatalities decreased by 67%- one of the largest reductions among IRTAD countries. Since 2000, the number of injury crashes has decreased by 18%.\",\"Falls are a major problem for the elderly, both on pavements and in public transport vehicles, however data is seriously lacking. Initiatives such as Silver Zones, where the presence of older pedestrians is also indicated by road signs, can increase the safety of areas frequently visited by vulnerable road users. A major study was conducted by Liisa Hakamies-Blomqvist in Finland and Sweden (Hakamies-Blomqvist et al.,\",\"Setting ambitious and timely road safety targets can help communities work together towards zero deaths and serious injuries in traffic. For this reason, it is recommend that local authorities set such targets. As a result, road safety priorities in cities are specific to the protection of VRUs. These priorities include traffic calming, improved street design, speed limits and safer trucks.\",\"Before data collection and analysis can start, it is necessary to consider the question of which road safety indicators are considered relevant. Indicators can be used in policy making, for progress monitoring and for explaining developments, particularly in relation to the policy conducted. Good data are indispensable for this. When data are not good, erroneous decisions are possible. Improving road safety is a social issue, and society cannot afford to let dilettantes take erroneous decisions based on false data leading to unnecessary road casualties. In addition to their use in road safety policies, good data axe of extreme importance for research.\",\"This should be done through engagement with community groups such as parents of school children, local residents and campaign groups, including the families of those seriously injured and killed. These groups should be treated as partners in planning and decision-making. As a country that promotes advanced technology and which is a major producer of motor vehicles, Korea could be a world leader in introducing ISA. It can be noted that the 2014 Kia Sorrento sold in Europe already has the option of providing speed limit information to the driver based on map and camera technology. The same model also has a driver-set speed limiter function.\",\"The tool is intended to assist governments and decision makers in deciding on the most appropriate road safety policies and measures to achieve tangible results. The model is based on historical road safety data and relations between several road safety parameters, and provides information on different road safety scenarios.

The team thus identified the biggest barriers to better mobility in the city: motor vehicles and lack of space for pedestrians (including pavement obstructions in many places). It helps them to diagnose road safety problems, prioritise interventions and evaluate projects.\",\"Consequently, this has resulted in an upsurge in the numbers of road accidents in several countries within the region, particularly within metropolitan cities. Worldwide, road traffic takes the lives of nearly 1.3 million people every year, and injures 20-50 million more.127 According to the World Health Organization, road traffic fatalities are predicted to rise to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030, resulting in an estimated 2.4 million fatalities per year. Roads that are not capable of handling levels of traffic volume, are inadequate for the terrain, are poorly maintained and have poor visibility, can all contribute to road fatalities and injuries.\",\"This special issue contains contributions of the approach used in Western Australia (Corben et al., The various approaches show a great deal of similarity as well as differences. For this, knowledge is required of the safety effects \\u002fcasualty reduction per intervention unit, such as the effect of building one roundabout, or one hour spent on police enforcement.\",\"The measures need to be selected based on evidence of the results they can be expected to produce. Detailed ex-ante assessment is employed in countries at the leading edge of achievement. In the United Kingdom, for example, targets for specific users or types of crash are based on ex-ante assessments. In the Netherlands, overall targets for reducing deaths and serious injuries are tightened periodically and the accompanying measures modelled to assess whether they will deliver the improvement required to meet the new target.\",\"Therefore, in the same way that we inoculate a population against a disease, we can immunise a whole population against road trauma by reducing rates of drink-driving and speeding, and increasing the rates of safety belt and motor cycle helmet wearing. For many individual drivers or passengers, the risks of a collision and death or serious injury are low, and they will choose to drive drunk (or ride with a drunk driver), exceed the speed limit routinely, or not wear a safety belt, without ever being involved in a collision. Their individual experience convinces them that their behaviours are harmless or at least very low risk.\",\"The reports were sometimes incomplete, or had not been sent to the Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA), which was at that time responsible for the data entry, coding and analysis of crash reports. Injuries were often inaccurately recorded, if at all. Crash locations were often imprecise and Blood\\u002fBreath Alcohol levels, and pre-crash speeds, were not recorded in all cases. This combination of under-reporting of casualties and missing data resulted in important crash data not being captured, understating both the actual levels of road trauma and crash contributing factors.\",\"Since then, road deaths have steadily decreased (with some fluctuations) and were halved by 2004. In 2013, Korea counted 5 092 road deaths, a 62% decrease when compared to the level of 1991. With a population of 50.2 million, there are 19.4 million registered vehicles (i.e. around 400 vehicles per 1 000 inhabitants). Korea’s road network totals 106 414 km, which includes 4 111 km of motorway.\",\"A cross-sectional analysis reveals that mortality is 20% lower where density doubles. This is likely due to lower vehicle speed and greater use of public transport, but further investigation is needed. The Safer City Streets database and network could support such research. Answering this question requires looking beyond strict numbers of casualties and crashes to consider wider economic, health and well-being issues.\",\"Also, the age group of 80+ is the fastest growing population group and at the same time has the highest KSI (killed and seriously injured) rate leading to a strong need to focus on improving safety measures especially for this group. In each of them over 40% of casualties aged 65-69 were car drivers or passengers, but the proportion of car users decreases as age increases (Figure7.2). Thus, a much larger proportion of casualties in the 80+ age group were pedestrians.\",\"One of the largest and most compelling pieces of research to address this question was conducted in Ontario, Canada and published in the Lancet, a renowned medical publication. It concluded that: ‘Traffic-law enforcement effectively reduces the frequency of fatal motor-vehicle crashes in countries with high rates of motor-vehicle use. Inconsistent enforcement, therefore, may contribute to thousands of deaths each year worldwide.’ (\",\"In Western Australia, for example, thorough modelling was undertaken to assess the resources needed for police, road engineers and other sectors to achieve the government’s targets (Corben et al., In the Netherlands, the independent road safety data and analysis agency SWOV is charged with reviewing the national road safety programme each time it is revised, modelling the potential for measures announced to meet the targets adopted and proposing complementary measures when targets appear impossible to meet (Aarts et al., It is recommended to review the modelling techniques used in other OECD countries, and how their results impact the decision making process, budget allocation and communication with the public, and to develop a similar approach in Korea.\",\"The SRA established the Road Traffic Inspectorate to help monitor road safety performance and stakeholder activity.

Non-detection of stairs and kerbs is a frequent cause in cases of visual impairment (O'Neill 2013). Falls in public transport (PT) vehicles (O'Neill 2013) often also have to do with irregular flooring. Such falls may be frequent but the severity of the resulting injuries is assessed as only minor.\",\"These forward looking analyses suggest that new approaches may be needed to improve safety for all road users. The SRA and its partners have established databases to identify and monitor final and intermediate outcomes against targets and the results are published annually. The SRA uses the Euro NCAP and European Road Assessment Programme for monitoring the safety quality of vehicle fleet and aspects of road network safety.\",\"Data collected by the International Transport Forum (ITF) through the Safer City Streets network show pedestrians alone making up 45% of all road fatalities in Lisbon (Santacreu, 2018b). For each barrier a solution is indicated, with descriptions of necessary actions and respective cost estimate. This has enabled accurate cost estimates and integration of necessary actions in several public works that were not accessibility related. It provides predictions based on population density (2011 census) over 2 000 generators of pedestrian traffic (public facilities, public transport stations, etc.)\",\"It is an essential part of an overall road safety strategy, but other considerations, such as emissions management to improve air quality and curbing high speeds in order to maintain smooth traffic flows and thereby reduce incidents, may also be incorporated. Speed management is a vital element in an overall safety strategy and countries and territories that have been successful in their strategic approach to road safety have also invariably incorporated speed management as a major element in strategy. Here Sweden’s Vision Zero philosophy that no traffic participant should suffer a fatality or serious injury can provide guidance. Speed limits should be set so that crashes, if they occur, will not result in a death or serious injury. So, human tolerance for injury and the potential for protecting humans in different circumstances can be used to establish speed limits on different kinds of roads.\",\"In addition to largely one way broadcast type communications a number of countries are using communications for interactive, two way conversations. These methods may be important for building understanding, capacity and in mobilising demand for safety and the safe system. Public transport remains vital to the safe system. This can involve significant challenges but also opportunities for leadership and management as discussed earlier in this paper.\",\"Integrated, holistic and linked data bases have been established in leading countries to match the records of crashes contained in police records with data from health, insurers and other sources to form a complete picture of the road crash problem and more recently the level of severity of injury occurring. These “matched databases” involves establishing memoranda of understanding between agencies to manage issue such as privacy and, integrity and confidentiality. Both the police report number and the real number are published annually since 1996.\",\"Highly visible patrol cars (including the use of multiple base colours) and a distinctively visible livery are a successful feature of the New Zealand road policing programme (see Figure 5.4). The battenburg livery style has been tested and found to be more easily recognised by the public and adds to policing visibility Harrison, 2004). The use of a mix of marked and unmarked police vehicles using mobile mode radar has also been effective.\",\"In particular, the recent integration of police data and insurance companies’ data on road traffic accidents has allowed for a standardisation of statistics. Previously, there were tremendous discrepancies between the traffic accident statistics from the National Police Agency (Traffic Accident Management System - TAMS) and those released by the Korea Insurance Development Institute. Just as an example, in 2005, the National Police Agency-registered only 214 171 traffic accidents, whereas the Korea Insurance Development Institute registered 807 253, almost four times higher (Park, 2008).\",\"Conversely, a lack of enforcement will typically see poor wearing rates. Also included in the intermediate outcome measures are independently conducted public surveys that will test the perceived likelihood of being caught speeding, belief that an individual can predict where a compulsory breath testing checkpoint will be and admissions of drink-driving. These survey measures also provide valuable feedback to police on how effective their operations are in changing public attitudes and behaviours that cause or worsen road trauma. It is important to compare offence detection rates with known offending rates.\",\"The lead agency does not have to be responsible for conducting all activities but it does have to co-ordinate and to report regularly on progress towards targets to the highest levels of government. In Korea, road safety responsibility is shared between various agencies. The Transport Safety Act is managed by The Ministry of Land, Transportation and Infrastructure (MOLIT) while the Road Traffic Act, covering key areas of safety, is managed by the Police. Each ministry can propose road safety-related measures as well as a budget to achieve them, however, there is no overall co-ordination process for the allocation of a road safety budget.\",\"Western Australia has achieved a 30% reduction in the rate of fatalities and a 20% reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured at the half way point of the Towards Zero strategy. While this in encouraging, further work is being conducted as WA seeks to increase its rate of improvement to match and catch up to the performance of leading jurisdictions in Australia and overseas. A further Government review of road safety governance and management was conducted to ensure that the administration and management of road safety in Western Australia is optimal to help achieve better performance and implementation with a focus on management by results and accountability for performance.\",\"People involved in accidents who are 65 years or older incur a relatively higher share of accident cost in accidents involving pedestrians and motorised vehicles than other age groups (Figures 2.13 and Figure A.3). The difference arises both because relatively more elderly people are victims in such accidents and because the injuries they sustain tend to be more severe than the injuries of younger victims. The total percentage of accident cost from such accidents accounts for 52.7% of total accident costs for the elderly, but only 26.3% of the total cost for all other people affected by traffic accidents.\",\"Source: TfL (2013). The indicator considers the total number of road traffic fatalities across all modes. To make it comparable across cities, it is normalised by volume of motor vehicle traffic, which covers all types of road motor vehicles subject to registration. That excludes pedal cycles but includes mopeds, motorcycles, cars, goods vehicles and buses. This indicator reveals higher fatality rates in the areas which are the most densely populated.\",\"The city government is also planning on enhancing road safety infrastructure equipment, particularly in the areas with the highest frequency of traffic accidents and protected areas. Planned measures include increasing the use of light-reflecting traffic signs for better visibility at night, increasing the size of road traffic signs, demolishing pedestrian overpasses (currently there are 14 remaining in the city), removing road side trees or installations at the comer of crossroads that hamper the vision of drivers and pedestrians, etc. The city government has announced the creation of a task force in collaboration with road safety experts, the police, the KoTSA, citizen associations, etc. The Master Plan is currently running in its seventh edition (2012-16) and is put into operation as an Action Plan every year.\",\"This 2002 study covered drinking and driving, seat belt and child restraint use, local infrastructure improvements on urban and minor rural roads, and safety on main interurban roads. The thinking is based on a road safety target hierarchy of the final outcomes (the number killed and injured), intermediate outcomes (Safety Performance Indicators), safety programmes and measures, and “structure and culture” as shown in Figure 4.5. This approach is adapted from a consultation document on a road safety strategy in New Zealand (LTSA, 2000).\",\"While such metrics would not replace indicators based on casualty numbers, they could alleviate some difficulties associated with the comparability and statistical power of casualty figures. This is essential given the proven relationships between speed and crash risk {ITF, 2018b) and the contribution that speeding plays in making people feel unsafe on the streets. Technology could play a role and support such analysis.\",\"Specific deterrence is the actual experience of being sanctioned for the speeding behaviour. This may be an immediate sanction in the form of being stopped by a police officer and issued an infringement notice, or receiving an infringement later if detected by a speed camera. Research suggests that complex behaviours are not deterred by highly visible enforcement, but through the actual experience of detection. Other complex behaviours include unsafe overtaking or lane changes, which are driver behaviours that are momentary and involve complicated thought processes and may be performed during a journey.\",\"The estimated benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) from ISA-UK is 7.4 for a scenario in which the authorities actively promote ISA deployment through regulation (Lai et al., Cars with intervening ISA score more highly than cars with an advisory ISA. Extra points are also given for vehicles that combine map-based ISA with a camera-based sign recognition system. The conclusion was: “The most effective driver support system is ISA” (page 50).\",\"Speed cameras work effectively in many locations and can be operated at fixed locations, often known speed related crash risk sites, or through mobile vehicle mounted cameras. Mobile speed cameras are intended to have a general impact upon speed offending across the network. Mobile speed cameras are most effective when they are operated in a non-overt manner utilising unmarked vehicles (Cameron, 2009).\",\"The measures need to be included in national and local road safety programmes and fully funded. Targets should be set ‘bottom-up', that is based on the modelled potential to reduce deaths and serious injuries of the interventions planned for introduction or intensification of enforcement. Preferably, a target should be expressed in terms of an absolute number of casualties (deaths or seriously injured) to be saved rather than in terms of a rate (e.g. number of deaths per 100 000 population).\",\"In London, such cameras are now being used to enforce 20 mph (30 km\\u002fh) zones. So drivers have not just been scared into compliance, they have been persuaded to do so. That, no doubt, helps to explain the general improvement in compliance which extends far beyond the well-publicised sites of speed cameras.\",\"This is very likely a major explanation for the reported differences. It is advisable to develop and apply a generally accepted method for making road crash costs estimates. As to output, this concerns, for instance, the way in which the data are made available for further processing and analysis. As to the use of the data, this refers to the actual use by road safety stakeholders and researchers. The possible and actual use of data by road safety stakeholders and researchers can be considered as a main indicator of the quality of a data system. The more possibilities there are to analyse the data, the better the quality of data systems.\",\"In the case of international research, it is essential that data are comparable or are made comparable. This leads to the conclusion that it is advisable to pursue harmonization of road safety data. This starts with definitions to be used (e.g. the 30-day definition of a road death) and also involves the harmonisation of methodologies for data collection (e.g. when collecting data about Safety Performance Indicators). In every case of international comparisons, comparability of data has to be ascertained.\",\"This territorial and administrative mismatch of responsibilities has a direct negative impact on road safety matters, which often are not co-ordinated between the municipalities. The city administration has over 8 000 employees spread across 15 municipal directorates and 46 departments. It is also responsible for all matters related to traffic management and safety on this network, except for river bridges and the urban highway system. Boroughs are the lowest tier of local government in Portugal.\",\"James Reason from the United Kingdom wrote an influential book “Human Error” (Reason, 1990). The model developed by Reason, sometimes referred to as the “Swiss Cheese Model”, has been adapted to road safety (Wegman and Aarts, 2005). His “slices of cheese” have different hiatuses, or holes in the cheese.\",\"However, the lack of evidence on the overall rollout of the SER concept, e.g. in the Netherlands, is not very surprising: the concept is so wrapped up in the overall Dutch safety strategy (which has been a general success story) that it is hard to single out the effect of this particular element. They tend to overestimate their speed reduction. This creates a need to reinforce the perception of driving speed, particularly at transitions to lower speed limits, on the entry to towns and villages, on the approach to intersections and on the approach to sharp curves.\",\"These shorter terms action plans provide opportunity to adjust and refine interventions from the results of monitoring and review of performance. Some examples from different jurisdictions are shown in the boxes below. Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications, Stockholm, May 2009. Realistically we understand that it is not practical to achieve zero serious injuries on our roads by the year 2020, but we do not accept any death or serious injury as inevitable.”\",\"The relationship is straightforward: there is higher risk of disability at older ages. Informal estimates suggest that some two-thirds of people with disabilities are over retirement age and that one-third of older people have some kind of disability. The prevalence and severity of disability increases with older old age (currently 80 years plus). Many older people are affected by a range of impairments including some loss of visual acuity, some loss of hearing, short term memory loss and difficulty gripping, climbing (steps) and balancing.\",\"This will increase accessibility, usability and comfort in the public space and prolong general mobility. Older car drivers especially need support, in view of their abilities and deficiencies in certain situations, as well as information on how to compensate for cognitive and sensory limitations. In Korea, the prevailing view was that lowering speed limits is an inconvenience to drivers, and that reductions without a clear reason would be seen as unfair and lead to increased social costs.\",\"The Cycling Development Concept was based on preliminary analysis of crashes involving cyclists across the city. The analysis of road traffic crashes showed that crashes involving cyclists were strongly concentrated in the city centre and on the main radial roads, pointing to the locations where measures to improve road safety were needed. Thus, the first actions to improve cycling infrastructure involved central Riga and the main arteries. Within the scope of the concept, attention has been paid to improving existing infrastructure, e.g. reducing pavement borders, doing street cover repairs and improving traffic organisation.\",\"The main focus of the plan in public spaces has been pavements, crossings, bus stops and reserved parking for people with disabilities. The city thus aimed at reducing barriers to walking, adapting existing environmental design and raising awareness among pedestrians and road users, all of which are measures to improve autonomous access to services and comprise a starting point for reducing social isolation. The matter generated intense public debate, as cobblestones are associated with Lisbon's visual identity. However, cobblestones make pavements irregular, uncomfortable and slippery, reducing safety and accessibility.\",\"This implies a fully co-ordinated approach with interventions from each agency with responsibilities for road safety implemented in concert. It also demands enforcement effort dosed to achieve optimal results and ensure measures are mutually reinforcing. It requires effective leadership from a unit at the highest levels of government to facilitate the work of the road safety agencies, co-ordinate then- interventions and be the main interface with NGOs and the private sector.\",\"At the federal\\u002fnational level, competences are often limited, so it is important to strongly engage local agencies, including local road authorities and police agencies, in actively committing to road safety. This may require allocating adequate funding to local agencies. Urban sprawl and fragmentation of public transport planning create car-dependent communities, which in turn make it harder to develop road safety policies addressing car traffic speed and volume.\",\"The course was evaluated in 2011 on the basis of a sample of 2 100 drivers from 70 years on who had reported an accident to their insurance company during a two-year period. About 24% of the sample had completed the course prior to the accident. Drivers who had taken the refresher course before turning 75 years old were found to be at a 35% lower risk of being involved in multiple vehicle crashes compared to older drivers who had not taken the course (Ulleberg et al.\",\"Several studies have shown that older drivers are to a large extent willing to consider using and buying ADAS such as reversing aids and collision warning systems that are aimed at the prevention of crashes on intersections (Oxley and Mitchell 1995, Viborg 1999). Furthermore, older drivers are also willing to accept systems that give feedback messages or that (partly) take over vehicle control, like automatic speed or distance adjustment (Viborg 1999). The drivers should also be able to understand the information the ADAS sends, via a display, by sound, or haptic. Older drivers are also more susceptible to poorly defined ADAS than younger drivers.\",\"The amount of driving in the speed range just over the limit is explained by the design of the ISA system, which gave the drivers some margin before cutting in. A similar pattern can be seen in Figure 6.10, which shows the speed distribution on the 70 mph (112 km\\u002fh) roads which are mainly motorways. Probably the most comprehensive set of calculations is that from the trials conducted in the ISA-UK project. The prediction is that an advisory ISA in general use would save 3% of injury accidents and an intervening ISA would save 12% of injury accidents and 20% of fatal accidents.\",\"A focus on urban road safety is therefore twice beneficial: in addition to preventing a number of deaths and serious injuries, the unlocking of active travel options is at stake. Research is needed to put a value on this fear and reveal the true scale of urban road safety benefits. Since the fear of crashes is a major burden in cities, it is natural to recommend measuring and monitoring it.\",\"Both ratios are used side by side and they definitely are not interchangeable. The OECD\\u002fITF report entitled “Reporting on serious road traffic casualties” (2011) advocates considering injury consequences as a relevant outcome indicator of road crashes, next to fatal injuries. Sometimes, the (economic) costs of crashes and injuries resulting from crashes are also considered to be outcome indicators.\",\"In addition to road and transport infrastructure, Kim et al. ( Using data for 2010 and a variety of econometric techniques, including oidinaiy least squares and spatial error models, they consider factors that affect the total number of the accidents in a TAZ. In additioa they consider separately factors that are associated with accidents that caused severe injuries (requiring more than three weeks of hospitalisation) or deaths, and factors associated with accidents that resulted in light injuries (three or fewer weeks of hospitalisation).\",\"A process of modelling the expected results of the government’s road safety programme needs to be undertaken on a routine basis by one of the road safety agencies. Where projected results fall short of targets the programme should be revised and reinforced. Resourcing and coordination would be improved by re-establishment of a unit reporting to the highest levels of government responsible for the delivery of government road safety targets.\",\"Maps could be updated over the air, and C-ITS could enable dynamic ISA systems in which the speed limits were adjusted according to the prevailing conditions, just as they currently are in Smart Motorway management. So dynamic speed management could be extended to all roads, without any need for the expensive installation of variable message signs. The communications technology for this could be based on existing mobile phone networks.\",\"Between 1990 and 1993 the TAC strategy helped prevent an estimated 10 800 serious casualty crashes and halved the state's road toll over the five years from December 1989 (Cameron et al., The initial priorities were drink driving and driving at excessive speed. The strategy of the campaign was to have an increased law enforcement presence on the roads supported by hard-hitting, high-profile advertising.\",\"Intelligent Transportation System technologies are developing rapidly, and it is expected that ISA could be implemented without major obstacles. The adoption of a bold vision with the safe system approach will enable Korea through its leading agencies and organizations, together with the community to fundamentally change the way it approaches road safety improvement. This will involve moving current thinking and practice from “ decisions about the next incremental improvement ” to “ decisions on how to achieve the ultimate outcome of zero serious harm and then working backwards from the ultimate to the current” to determine the next steps forward along the safe system journey.\",\"A closer look at data on pedestrian fatalities highlights that it is in fact one of the main contributors to the large gap between Korea and other OECD countries. Korea’s per 100 000 inhabitant pedestrian fatality rate is not only higher than in any of the other 29 countries that report this statistic, but exceeds the average for all other countries statistically significantly. Table 2.2 shows the results of pairwise t-tests comparing Korea with 28 other countries.\",\"Road safety action plans should be integrated or linked to SUMPs, since road safety is critical to making active travel both popular and inclusive. Governments should establish a framework for the collection and reporting of relevant urban mobility and casualty figures. Such urban mobility and road safety observatories should also be integrated into the development and review of SUMPs. This would make it easier to analyse and interpret road safety trends.\",\"The programme targets pedestrian safety issues through legislative measures and innovative street design, such as lowering speed limits and the reconfiguration of crossings. Launched in 2013, Sao Paulo observed a 20.6 per cent drop in traffic fatalities from 2014 to 2015. With better public awareness around road safety and lower speeds, there are 30 per cent less traffic fatalities. To ensure public understanding and support, the programme created a platform for discussion and education through multiple workshops.\",\"Measures to reduce fatalities and serious injuries among the elderly should also focus on creating conditions for safe walking, cycling and using public transport. Korea should adopt a strategic approach to speed management, including a comprehensive review of road functions and speed limits. Current urban speed limits in Korea, typically 60 km\\u002fh, are too high and compliance is poor. This is to the detriment of safety, particularly of vulnerable road users including elderly pedestrians.\",\"Many countries in the region have a renewed focus on this mode of transport, with 19 countries in the ESCAP region adopting either national or subnational policies to promote the use of non-motorized modes of transport such as walking and cycling. However, according to the 2013 Global Status Report, only seven countries in the ESCAP region have a policy to separate VRUs from high speed traffic at the national level, while nine countries have a policy at a subnational level. Measures to reduce speeds, in particular in urban areas with high concentrations of VRUs, can significantly limit the incidence of death and injury.\",\"It combines an international comparison of traffic safety trends with a detailed analysis of Korean accident data. The analysis on Korea uses a novel data set that contains more than 1 800 records of individual road traffic accidents with more than 6 500 affected individuals and data from the detailed analysis of 1 000 accidents around “accident hotspots”. The analysis of accident data is complemented by an in-depth assessment of the complex traffic safety governance arrangements in Korea and an identification of key areas for further improvement. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.\",\"Collision between vehicles driving at a crossroad, 9.

number of studies have provided evidence of the positive role of physical (urban) planning in effectively curbing long-term urban GHG emissions (notably from transport), although this type of instrument has not been shown to be effective in the short term (Greene and Schafer, 2003, Rietveld, 2006). Cities’ reactions to changes in the spatial structure (involving the relocation of activities, new buildings and new infrastructure) occur with a certain time lag. Mismatch between land use and transportation policies has all too often aggravated traffic congestion around metropolitan cities. For instance, the introduction of a beltway around Seoul in 1999 was succeeded by the construction of five new cities (Bundang, Ilsan, Pyeongchon, Sanbon, and Jungdong) around Seoul three years later, leading to considerable traffic congestion. Another case is the development northwest of the Yong-in area.\",\"Recharging also requires a non-contact recharging facility to be installed at the station (such a recharging system is running in other Korean cities such as Jeju, Suwon and Pohang). The introduction of compressed natural gas buses is another example of low-pollution transport policy in Sejong. The central government provided a subsidy to Sejong to help the city adopt CNG buses. Sejong’s bus network includes 72 routes, served by 130 buses, among which 24 are BRT types.\",\"In sum, accessibility-oriented decision-making frameworks need to be flexible and adaptable to the different realities found across territories, allowing for analysis, interpretation and identification of solutions that are customised for diverse existing conditions. It is essential to move away from exclusively regional accessibility analysis - which generally focuses on the maximum distance reachable via the fastest mode - and also consider neighbourhood accessibility needs. Silva and Larsson (2018) argue that focusing on regional accessibility can result in local accessibility effects being disregarded and often leads to accessibility losses at the neighbourhood scale.\",\"Routes, transfer stations, schedules and ticketing are poorly co-ordinated and integrated in the Agglomeration. Changing this and developing a long-term perspective for system improvements will necessitate political, economic and organisational measures (Solodkij and Gorev, 2013). An integrated and efficient transport system will need to be built on clear rules and close co-ordination among different stakeholders of the system.\",\"Its total population (based on TL5 data) that lives within a ten-minute walking distance from a bus stop is 81% (compared to 75% in Daejeon, second-ranked) and 19.8% within a ten-minute walking distance from a train station on average (compared with 12.2% in Busan, second-ranked). Most areas in Seoul have a balanced level of accessibility to bus stops and train stations, which is quite unique compared with other TL3 regions in Korea. A comprehensive public transport network, composed of 9 subway lines, 355 intra-city bus routes and 238 village bus routes, serves Seoul’s 25 autonomous districts (gu) (Seoul, 2016a).\",\"Sustainable transport decisions must be scaled up and expanded so that cities do not get locked into infrastructure that pollutes, generates economic loss, limits opportunities and endangers lives. Recognizing how unsustainable transport affects urbanization, some cities are now investing heavily in mass transit and acting to limit car sales and usage. These meeting have brought together various stakeholders including national statistical offices, national and local governments, transport authorities.\",\"Uber fares were capped at the cost of the train ride (EUR 16.80), approximately 30% lower than the un-capped average Uber fare on the same route. Using in-app geofencing and a promotion code, riders requested UberX service from within 20 metres of designated Night Rider stops to any location within one of three geographic zones. Qualifying rides received a AUD 10 discount covered half by the ACT Government and half by Uber.\",\"The data collected through these subnational centres will be linked to the national system on mass transport information, TAGO (Transport Advice on GOing anywhere), to promote smart mobility at the national level. The centres will be grouped together and jointly operated by subnational entities to reduce costs. The first joint BIS centre is scheduled to be launched in 2017 through a partnership of 15 jurisdictions in Gangwon-do.\",\"This is aligned with the OECD’s argument that linking urban areas with public transport is one of the three key characteristics of the compact city (OECD, 2012a). Several policy initiatives to promote public transport, in particular as expressed in government documents including the “Greening Urban and Building Initiative” announced by Korea’s Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs in 2009, should be continuously implemented, to send a consistent signal to local government and private investors. More roads could invite more traffic. “ The volume of car traffic almost everywhere is more or less arbitrary, depending on the available transportation infrastructure. Because we can always find new ways to increase our car use, building extra roads is a direct invitation to buy and drive more cars.” ( Since the 1989 earthquake, San Francisco has converted certain freeways to city streets, which has turned the Embarcadero into a city boulevard with trolley cars, trees and wide sidewalks.\",\"Because they run generally profit-clearing services, the cost-savings attraction of partnering with innovative mobility services may not be very compelling. But there is room for seeking out partnerships to improve certain operational aspects of services - especially if they attract riders out of congested networks at peak times. Self-provided services are common feature in North America and, to a lower extent, elsewhere. These types of operators have generally emerged from the privatisation of commercial operators when these lost market share in the face of rising car use.\",\"The EDF measures what the service frequency would be if the service were available without having to walk. This allows a comparison of routes according to service frequency: routes with the highest service frequency score are assigned a weight of 1, while all others have a weight of 0.5 (TfL, 2015). A separate accessibility indicator (Al) is initially calculated using this methodology for various modes, including bus, rail, underground and tram.\",\"Their efforts are reflected in a series of projects that promote walking and cycling, and prioritise allocation of road space and investment in favour of public and non-motorised transport. Planning and legal instruments linked to mobility policy have also been modified in the Federal District, to introduce principles of sustainability and inclusiveness. Locally driven initiatives have also coincided with a growing role of urban mobility in the national agenda. These efforts have laid important foundations and made considerable progress.\",\"Other proposed or existing congestion charging schemes are not limited to fine-tuning to the same extent. Given the weaker degree of integration of the various components of transport policy elsewhere, the mismatch between demand during peak hours and capacity may be larger than in Singapore in many cases. Traffic volumes have declined in all time periods, suggesting there is more trip elimination than rescheduling.\",\"It explores each city’s strengths and challenges in terms ofpublic transport policy, with an analysis of accessibility and inclusiveness when available. The first three cities were selected as case studies because they received several awards from the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) in “sustainable transport” and “public transport policy evaluation” (Box 3.1). The fourth city, Sejong, offers a unique case of a city entirely planned and created by the central government as a new administrative hub of Korea, which is strongly committed to transit-oriented development (TOD).\",\"This chapter focuses on what it would take to make innovative mobility services accessible and acceptable to, and useable by, older people and people with physical, sensory or cognitive impairments. This is due to a close correlation between age and disability, as populations age, disability becomes more prevalent. Virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number of older people in their population.\",\"The first are relatively straightforward to measure, as they are the marginal labour and vehicle operating costs, measured through costs for fuel and vehicle maintenance. Costs associated to schedule delay and non-adherence are harder to grasp, and can be classified into three categories. These are especially harmful in the context of just in time delivery practises, flexible inventories and perishable goods.\",\"In Helsinki, there is a large potential for electrification to deliver benefits due to the small fleet increases that would be necessary, along with the relative infrequency with which range becomes a mobility constraint. Cost savings become less significant with smaller fleets due to the necessity of recovering the additional investment costs. This is generally found to yield significant reductions in mobility costs, on the order of 50% for shared taxi and taxi-bus costs per kilometre.\",\"Such tools can help to set common standards and make accessibility considerations a central criterion for decisions by multiple stakeholders. Deficits in the quality of access to opportunities that different groups experience should also be identified. This requires developing methodologies for collecting qualitative information regarding satisfaction with available services, for instance, based on surveys. Such studies should aim to identify where different groups of citizens (e.g. of a certain age, occupation or gender) lack appropriate access through available transport modes.\",\"Supported by innovative and diverse technologies around renewables, decreased cost and decoupling energy-related carbon emissions is possible. Investing in clean energy solutions with off-grid and mini-grid supply lowers energy consumption, maintenance costs and risks of defect installations. Vehicles and public transportation are increasingly transferring to hybrid or electric, but school buses continue to predominantly use external combustion engines fuelled by diesel or gasoline. To ensure that children’s transportation to school uses clean energy.\",\"It has therefore been suggested that cultivating alternative sources of transport financing should be a priority. The periods on the xaxis correspond to the seven 5-year economic development plans, which were first launched in 1962 and terminated in 1997. However, more recently, the share of its total public investment devoted to transport infrastructure decreased from 8.2% to 6.6% between 2006 and 2015. Railways - and especially high-speed railways - have also gradually surfaced back as an alternative response to car-centred development and to the side effects of the latter, such as congestion and environmental degradation.4 The high-speed Korea Train eXpress (KTX), first inaugurated in 2004, handled 42.3% of total rail traffic in 2010.\",\"It also may harm families. This new combination of objectives has complex implications on the financial model that could help Korean cities cope with such evolving demand. Although only 6.8% of the overall transport infrastructure in Korea is more than 30 years old (as of 2014),9 this share will rise to 30% by 2030 and the corresponding maintenance costs are expected to increase by 6.1% per annum by 2030 (Kim, 2016).\",\"In the case of the CETRAM Zapata, most commercial development has been connected to car park facilities, with no connections to the CETRAM.38 The overall result has little to do with encouraging transit-oriented development and the use of public rather than private transport. Another shortcoming of the modernisation projects is the limited access to the facilities for people with disabilities. The persistence of a divided public space within CETRAM and between the centres and their surrounding areas makes walking difficult (Medina, 2013).\",\"Some of the inherent conflicts that may need to be overcome in the previous two models are not necessarily present and the potential contribution of ride services to an overall vision and objectives for transport can be more objectively assessed and acted upon. This is in theory at least, because in practice, public transport organising authorities in Europe have been particularly loathe to seek out partnerships with ride services and most of the innovation in this field comes from North America. This may stem from the strength and effectiveness of traditional public transport service in European countries as well as from an institutional bias in favour of traditional public transport service delivery models.\",\"Finally, redundancy is about spare facilities that compensate for the failing of other infrastructure. The bicycling era has not lasted too long, as especially in North America the automobile revolution starting at the beginning of the 20m century made the car a favoured form of transportation whether urban or sub-urban, while the bicycle become predominantly a children toy or means for pass-time. The situation looks different in developing countries, in particular, in Africa and Asia, where walking and cycling continuous to be the dominant form of mobility .This however is largely not by choice, but rather driven by lackof affordable and accessible alternatives, with many pedestrians and cyclist belonging to lower income groups2'. People pay a low tee to use the bicycles from one of the many bicycle parking stations located in the city and they can return them to any station they wish. \\\" Freedom bikes\\\" in Paris fill the streets, proving more popular than anticipated.\",\"Merseytravel, the local transport authority responsible for co-ordinating public transport in the Liverpool City Region, used accessibility analysis to estimate the impact of the more distant location, and to identify where new bus services would be needed. The assessment showed that providing the bus services required to maintain accessibility levels similar to those before relocation would mean a costly investment. When faced with the potential transport cost of the relocation, the health authority decided it would be cheaper to redevelop the hospital on the city centre site. Without conducting accessibility-based analysis, health authorities will often choose to build a new hospital on cheaper land far from a city centre so to make better use of the health budget.\",\"The elements in this category include journey time reliability, labour supply (number of people that can now access the labour market due reduced commuting costs) and static clustering (i.e. how reductions of generalised transport costs bring firms and households closer together, leading to productivity gains). This involves determining whether these impacts, either individually or collectively, are likely to alter the overall value for money of the proposal. Methodologies in this category are not considered robust enough for inclusion in the BCR, but are used to inform the Value for Money (VfM) category.\",\"A common version of these indicators (the simplest contour-based indicators) also makes use of thresholds (e.g. number of services reachable in 30 minutes), with all activities within and beyond the threshold treated as equally important. These indices include an impedance function or sensitivity cost in the equation, which decreases the desirability of routes according to given characteristics - distance or road quality, for example. Simply put, destinations that are closer to the origin, or served by better roads, are given a larger weight than those that are farther or have poorer roads.\",\"The main artery road in the north-south direction (a #1 national road) and the circular roads in the administrative city are picked out at the global level (Figure 3.17). The new administrative city is particularly poorly serviced by public transport - this may be problematic given the weak local integration already present in the area. The new administrative centre is also weakly integrated locally, meaning that moving around this centre may be challenging - a situation that is not helped by the relatively poor access to bus stops in this area.\",\"Ownership of cell phone is more likely among persons with disabilities living in urban areas than in rural areas, although ownership is less likely than for persons without disabilities: in urban areas, 62 per cent of households with persons with disabilities own a cell phone compared to 69 per cent of households without persons with disabilities, in rural areas, 46 per cent of households with persons with disabilities compared to 50 per cent of households without persons with disabilities own a cell phone. Four selected indicators on education, health, employment and access to ICT, by disability status and area of residence. For example, the Swedish Building Code requires all units in residential buildings of three levels or more to have wheelchair access, large lifts and kitchens and bathrooms of certain dimensions.\",\"Additionally, extensive desk research for this study was carried out by the International Transport Forum. This will have an impact on the nature of public transport. The convergence of public transport and ride services in particular provides an opportunity to deliver better mobility outcomes for a broader share of the population.\",\"This seems to be the case for many of the US-based pilot programmes. As part of this provision, real-time mapping system would need to be able to locate and book the nearest accessible vehicle. In all circumstances and situations, an adequate pool of accessible vehicles would need to be available at all times so that people with disabilities did not have to wait (much) longer than other people to make their trip. There is some experimentation underway (e.g. Uber in New York City) on mixing short-term leases for accessible vehicles, a flat incentive payment for drivers undertaking those trips and reduced commissions by the ride service platform.\",\"Further reductions in traffic volume in urban areas could be achieved through the implementation of a Vehicle Quota System, to directly control the growth of the vehicle stock (as is the case in Singapore). To increase the political acceptability of these types of fiscal disincentives, complementary measures to improve public transport should also be implemented so as to limit redistributive inequities. Fees collected could be invested for improvements in public transit, as in London.\",\"In this regard, it should be kept in mind that land use planning policies aiming at rather compact cities are those, which would enable and result in a high-occupancy public transport service®. In this context, establishment of effective and efficient urban transport system requires that the necessary infrastructure, including for the various public transport modes, be built so that it is reasonably resistant to the effects of extreme weather events caused by climate change. Resilient means that negative consequences of an extreme weather event can be easily restored. Compartmentalizing is about making compartments so that an infrastructure failure can be limited to a certain area.\",\"In those areas, those who can afford cars, who find them a more convenient option to low-frequency, inflexible bus services and who can safely operate them have already largely abandoned bus services - even if these services may feed into higher frequency and better quality public transport networks. Those bus users who remain are often captive users who have few alternatives. In these contexts, ride services can be (and have been) seen as a way to deliver the same trips as those delivered by some bus services but at lower overall costs.\",\"Experts suggest creating a buffer or service area around the designated stop of the public transport within a 500-metre walking distance. Countries with more advanced systems of data collection may wish to conduct an entire network analysis within the same buffer, but paying attention to the street network, as part of a physical accessibility component.7 They can also adapt to the transit system separating non-rapid transit (the conventional bus) from rapid transit (the metro light rail. Bus Rapid Transit -BRTj etc) at a 1.000-metre walking distance.8 Experts also proposed to consider including formal and informal transport systems, yet, in many countries, there is no clear way of defining stops for informal transport.9 It is also suggested to disaggregate information to the greatest extent possible when reporting,10 although this requires major efforts (mainly surveys) which are still lacking in most cities. The share of population with access to public transport depends on several factors.\",\"Among the agencies operating public transport in the ZMVM, only Metrobus, ECOBICI and the suburban railway are collecting and making use of the data provided by smart cards for planning and optimisation. In many cases, data collection and several modelling exercises (e.g. origin-destination for certain areas of the city, estimation of modal shift and C02 emission mitigation, demand forecasting, environmental impact assessments) are carried out with the aim of implementing specific projects (underground line extensions, BRT corridors, bike lanes). However, information is currently neither used nor verified between agencies or gathered into an integrated model that could guide overall mobility planning. Poor long-term modelling and forecasting capacity will limit the ZMVM’s long-term vision for mobility planning.\",\"Pilots allow a safe, time-bound, space for experimentation and ensure that ex-post evaluation occurs before the initiative is prolonged, adapted or terminated. Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons, however, that these initiatives are run as pilots is that they allow public authorities to enter into contractual agreements with service providers without going through typical procurement processes. This is due to the limited budget involved which in most instances is below the threshold for formal bid processes and due to the temporary nature of the partnerships. In some instances, however (the RIDE partnership in Boston), the pilot is run through a bid-based procurement process.\",\"These roles may be unified within one level of government or agency but in many instances it may be spread across several levels (national, regional or local). Even at any given level, responsibility may be spread across several departments or services with little top-level co-ordination. This complicates the task of aligning outcomes in, say, the regulation of ride services that may fall under those in charge of taxi or for-hire regulations and public transport regulation which may fall under a completely different authority. If transport governance structures contribute to this friction, it may be very difficult to even broach the subject of synergies between ride services and public transport, let alone experiment with them. This is certainly the case where, for any number of reasons, new ride services are prevented from operating or face constraining conditions. At a very basic level, split responsibility and split levels of decision-making may hamper the trialling of innovative new arrangements.\",\"For instance, they do not indicate whether transport improvement would actually meet various groups' access needs. However, land use is often included only in a broad way, disregarding competition effects. As an example, an indicator may reflect access to schools but not account for the types of schools to which different people want access, nor the competition for access to a specific school.\",\"One important conclusion so far is that thorough information making use of real-time data, presented in an appropriate way, has a great potential to enhance confidence in the public transport system. Electronic boards giving real time visual information about vehicle movements had already been fitted at city centre stops. Later, audio announcement modules were added to make the real-time information available to blind and partially sighted people.\",\"It comprises 42 railway connections with 390 stations and 943 bus routes with 11 900 stops. On average, it handles some 2.5 million passengers per workday, with an average length of travel of 10 kilometres. In terms of revenue per trip, it achieves a top value in Germany, covering its costs at 57%, with the remainder coming from federal regionalisation funds passed through the state budget, and from municipalities via state financial equalisation.\",\"For cities operating older buses, they should evaluate the impact of the cost savings on fuels versus increased leasing costs for new buses. Accessibilityforall neighbourhoods to public transport is an essential factor of social inclusion. Therefore, more investments are needed to improve accessibility.\",\"Developers lean on PTAL as the indicator in such assessments for London projects, as it helps them evaluate how new development would affect accessibility to public transport in a selected area and determine the acceptability of the impact. While it provides a useful indicator of local accessibility and allows easy comparison of areas across the city, one criticism is that it assumes access to a public transport network includes access to reasonably well-integrated rail and bus services and, by implication, to a range of final destinations. But PTAL does not in fact measure access to final destinations. That said, the Access to Opportunities and Services (ATOS) indicator - a complementary TfL measure that does reflect access to destinations and is described below - shows that in the case of London, a city with a comprehensive and relatively dense public transport network, PTAL is a good proxy for access to services and opportunities. In areas of lower density, however, the PTAL method may not be applicable as they usually have a sparser public transport network with poor connections and interchange facilities. Nor does it account for availability of cycling lanes or quality of walking environment.\",\"Uber has other one-time promotions in Des Moines, Iowa, and Dallas, Texas. During the same period, Uber also helped distribute (via their drivers) free pre-loaded EASY public transport passes to encourage riders to try mixing Uber and Metrorail. For several weeks between 00:30 and 4:00, Lyft offered up to a 75% discount for shared Lyft Line rides along the T line and Uber offered a flat USD 5 UberPOOL fare. They represent very early experimentation by companies and public authorities seeking synergies between the types of services provided by ride-sourcing and commercial ride-sharing companies and public transport operators.\",\"They can be applied descriptively to identify lack of accessibility to essential services in certain areas (i.e. to take stock of accessibility gaps). They can also be used to assess how various policy or infrastructure alternatives might change accessibility levels across territories and for different users, demonstrating how given options would contribute to or undermine the attainment of wider sustainability goals. Additionally, accessibility indicators can be used in ex post analysis, comparing a previous situation to the current one after implementation of a specific action.\",\"These are important metrics that allow agencies and authorities to understand how well users view the mobility offer on hand and whether or not it is compelling enough to effectively compete with car transport. This typically has occurred in an uncoordinated manner across different cities and countries but there are increasing calls for some form of standardised data-sharing from ride service companies to cities. Certain cities, like New York and London, have compelled ride services to share data in return for operational licensing, while yet others have been unsuccessful with the same companies - possibly because of a poorly structured or overly broad data requests.\",\"Simple measures include ensuring that design codes consider pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience as well as destination accessibility. Other initiatives include the establishment of public bike sharing schemes, which originated largely in Europe and the Americas, and are becoming more popular in the region. There has been particularly strong growth in China, a large-scale system in Huangzhou has 66 000 bicycles and 2 435 stations.\",\"In the bus network case, provided thatticket machines should be available at the majority of stops, such solution might be quite expensive for launching, in particular in comparison with more modern ways like through website and mobile services, already available in a few capital cities. The only case can be that of Sofia and Bucharest, which can be considered peer cities. They have the same number of public transport options and although Sofia has relatively a little bit more accessible public transport network in terms of length and stations, it is Bucharest that achieves higher relative demand while offering on average more ticket purchase options. The compilation of several capital cities shows, at the same time, that the more rich cities offer more ticket purchase options (figure 2.28.),\",\"The city is located in the middle of Korea, reachable from Seoul within an hour by express train. It resulted from the merger of Yeongi-gun and several towmships of Gongju-si and Cheongwon-gun, mainly on what used to be agricultural land. Today, 74.7% of the city’s land surface remains fields and farmlands, and over half will be reserved as parks and green space, according to the Sejong Urban Master Plan 2030.\",\"Meanwhile, more suburban locales have much lower parking rates (e.g. Buikslotermeerplein at EUR 1.3 per hour). These tariffs encourage visitors to the centre to take transit or bike without penalising residents. Out of total revenues of EUR 5 billion, more than 50% is derived from the national transfers to the local government.\",\"A shared, forward-looking vision of urban transport as an enabler of economic, environmental and social opportunities will play a key role in upgrading growth and quality of life in Korean cities. This figure only includes population living in predominantly urban regions (as defined in the OECD territorial classification). The sum of the share of population living in predominantly urban regions and that living in intermediate regions is 82.7%, compared with an OECD average of 73.7%. As of 2015, roads and railways accounted for around 45% and 33% of total traffic-related public investment, respectively (Kim, 2015).\",\"As a practical example, guidelines were established in Finland in 2004, involving the cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Joensuu, Tampere, Turku and Vantaa (Project \\\"Helsinki for All\\\"). The guidelines form the basis for the City of Helsinki Accessibility Plan and are freely available for use by other municipalities, corporations and planners. The guidelines contain criteria for evaluating the accessibility of outdoor locations: pedestrian crossings and pavements, pedestrian streets and squares, public courtyards, park paths and resting places, public bus stop areas etc.\",\"Due to the fact, however, that urban population, and especially that in capital cities, is expected to grow, a public transport network losing demand might be an issue of concern, in particular, if the demand is at relatively low level compared to private motorized transport. While this is a too short period for drawing meaningful conclusions, the demand levels should be carefully watched, and the causes for declines identified. Actions should then follow to reverse the negative trends.\",\"Gangnam regains its role as a centre of through-movement only at the global city-wide level. At this global scale, all the main artery' streets in Seoul are clearly picked up by high choice values - this includes Jongro, Sejongro and Dongdaemun (the latter famous for its market). These streets are also well-served by public transport.\",\"The latter typically look at specifying operational aspects of service provision: on-time performance, availability of service, location of stops and even detailed schedule-based frequency. These are adapted to the type of services route-based bus and rail services provide but make little sense for platform-based ride services. Coverage of services, average wait times (and their distribution) for both regular services and for accessible services, for example, all focus more on the outcomes that ride services can contribute to and may be more relevant for contracting with the providers of ride services. Currently, most of the pilots looking at the delivery of ride services allocate risk to the public authority contracting the service.\",\"In the context of the UK's transport appraisal this focuses particularly on the agglomerations of economic activity. Much of the agglomeration benefit arises from effectively bringing larger numbers of people and businesses closer together. In high-value service sectors like finance, this includes creating an environment where excellent accessibility for short trips is the essential feature, opening opportunities for frequent face-to-face contact and serendipitous meetings.\",\"Congestion charging had become necessary because vehicle traffic was a major problem in the city centre despite high public transit ridership, the cost of which was estimated to be approximately GBP 4 billion. The aim of the charge was to reduce traffic and congestion and to raise revenue that would be re-invested in transport. The congestion charge has had several impacts, including a 30% decrease in congestion, a reduction in the total number of vehicles entering the zone per day, a 15% reduction in circulating traffic per weekday, and an 11% mode share shift away from cars and towards public transit, walking and cycling.\",\"This assessment section includes impacts on security, severance, townscape, accessibility (in the meaning of usability of the transport system for people with physical and hidden disabilities), affordability, etc. It is important to note that non-monetised impacts require the most work and research for improving methodologies in order to better link these impacts to decision-making. This is important for not only essentially influencing whether the investment goes to particular scheme but also to serve as a basis for the adjustment of the scheme design. While improving methodologies for monetising accessibility benefits may help with this in some cases, in others, monetary valuation of accessibility gains - for instance when analysing distributional and spatial impacts - may be unnecessary, as a sole outcome ratio (such as the BCR) could be hiding relevant effects.\",\"The transport card can also be substituted with an ordinary bank card or a smart phone. This high-tech pricing system not only eliminates the user’s discomfort of having to queue to recharge the conventional pre-paid transport card, it also facilitates the collection of traffic big data. Considering that 99% of users in Seoul travel with a transport card (Seoul Solution, 2016), the data directly reflect consumer needs and indirectly signal consumer satisfaction. This opens up new opportunities for making transport and land-use decisions more responsive to community needs. Previously, bus stops and subway exits were scattered around the station without proper direction boards, which made transfers inconvenient and time-consuming. Therefore, the city government built a multi-modal transit centre, which brings together 89 bus routes on one spot within a close walking distance to subway lines 1 and 4, as well as KTX express railway (Seoul, 2016b).\",\"However, the city's master plan did not accommodate these trends. Car traffic intensity caused significant environmental, safety and economic consequences and required effective solutions. The aim is to strengthen the capacity of local authorities, NGOs and other stakeholders in planning for sustainable urban mobility in Polotsk, and to increase the role of the public and NGOs in adoption, implementation and evaluation of collaborative decisions on urban mobility planning in the city.\",\"In the case of Dublin, the recently developed portions of the bus network perform better than shared mobility, while the older, non-urban portions of the network do not perform as well as shared mobility. In Helsinki, replacing current bus feeder services with heavy public transport and replacing low frequency services with shared mobility both improve outcomes. All scenarios modelled reduce costs and increase connectivity and access.\",\"Through the platform, PTOs buy resources (taxi and bus service) from private companies, and, combined with all the planned trips - generated through different remote online ordering modules used by a number of authorities - optimise the utilisation of that capacity in real time. Because of volume discounts and auctioned prices, the PTOs realise cost-savings compared to if they had purchased these services through more traditional procurement routes. The spot-market seeks to ensure bids aligned with the lowest generalised cost on the basis of unit-prices (EUR per vehicle hour) submitted by operators every year alongside other factors including estimated trip distance and duration, proximity to the customer requesting the service, special needs the customer may have and the quality rating for participating hauliers. The longer-term market is comprised of two- to four-year contracts guaranteeing a minimum availability and quality assurances.\",\"Social interaction is a major factor in preventing both physical and mental decline (which represent a huge economic cost to society, as well as social and personal cost to the individual). Travelling as the only passenger is a vehicle will not provide the same stimulation and may cause anxiety, which leads to a preference for inclusive services, covering all users including those with access needs. Also, the ability to travel with a companion (at no extra costs) would help with this concern both for older people and for those with mental health issues or learning disabilities.\",\"The key strategy at this time was to foster the “growth pole”, which geographically corresponded to the so-called Gyungbu corridor linking Seoul to Busan and Ulsan. The government used public resources and external borrowing to finance the work, focusing first on manufacturing and services in Seoul. It then went on to create the heavy industry base along the southeast coast by building such industrial cities as Ulsan, the construction of which began in 1969, and a number of other industrial estates in that region. During the 1960s and 1970s, to improve efficiency, the government’s investment was concentrated on the high priority areas of Seoul, Incheon and Ulsan, so as to facilitate accessibility to human resources, subsidiary material, product sales and infrastructure. (\",\"Children and young individuals require special attention, as adequate transport access to educational institutions is crucial for their development. At the same time, elderly and\\u002for disabled individuals also have specific transport requirements. Estimates of the World Health Organization for the previous decade indicate that about 2.9 per cent of the global population was severely disabled and about 12.4 per cent was moderately disabled. The social inclusion of these groups requires reasonable access to health institutions and cultural and social activities and, therefore, increased requirements for transport accessibility (UNECE, 2012).\",\"These types of metrics may include on-time performance, average headways, and other operational aspects of public transport production. These are important but they do not capture how the public views the services being offered. Other metrics relating to wait times (average and distribution), frequency, the \\\"feel\\\" of the trip experience (e.g. Los Angeles is tracking transport \\\"happiness\\\"), overall convenience, etc.,\",\"Car dominance is higher than in Seoul (Figure 3.10). Currently, the bus accounts for around 30% of total commutes, compared with only 3% for the subway. However, as the Suwon city government forecasts, continued investments in railways (mainly the metropolitan subway in the capital area) will contribute to reshaping the traffic landscape of the city, giving a strong impulse to the city’s modal shift towards public transport (Suwon, 2016).\",\"These types of policies can be implemented to address externalities like noise and pollution intensity (including GHG emissions) associated with heavy6 cars and trucks. Zoning may influence the demand for transport volume, notably by reducing traffic by heavy cars in urban centres, which can in turn help to reduce GHG emissions per kilometre driven. Only recently, some metropolitan governments in Korea (for example, Daegu, Busan and Incheon) have introduced “Transit Mall Districts”, which are only accessible to public transit and bicycles.\",\"Like catchment analysis, the indicator measures accessibility in terms of travel time to jobs, education, health services, retail and open spaces. Unlike catchment analysis, which shows access to the nearest destinations, ATOS reflects the degree of choice by measuring, for example, access to the nearest three schools or doctors' surgeries. A \\\"basket\\\" of key services is used to calculate the indicator.\",\"So far, 13 796 compact cars, 3 568 hybrid cars and 24 electric cars have been registered in Suwon, and the city aims to increase the number of electric cars to 1 000 units by 2018, while replacing 50% of its official-purpose vehicles with electric cars. The fundamental philosophy of the city government is that ensuring the right to mobility for vulnerable users is a prerequisite to ensuring the full realisation of the universal right, because all citizens are bound to fall into a vulnerable state as a child or an elderly. In this respect, policy makers are trying to find the right balance between profitability and social equity.\",\"At the same time, a relatively high network of public transport stations is not a guarantee for a higher demand. A right number of stations should be such that on one hand would allow the citizens to find a station in a vicinity of their work, living, shopping or recreation places and, on the other hand, would not delay the transfers due to too frequent stops of the public transport modes. These ai measured per square kilometer compared to per 1000 popi much as 175 times (Brussels versus Oslo).\",\"The mechanisms involved are far more complex than is suggested by the argument that travel times increase with traffic volumes, as used in the basic rationale for charges. Charges are always an approximation to the theoretical ideal, so that decisions must be made on what approximation is best. Experience demonstrates that analytical approaches using disaggregated network models are more likely to produce an efficient result than prices based only on common sense.\",\"With the reform, the bus network has been fully reorganised into a trunk-feeder system, and buses are now classified into five types, which are serial-numbered and colour-coded to make it easier for users to recognise them. Traffic accidents have been halved during the last decade and citizens’ satisfaction has improved by 32% since the city government introduced an evaluation and incentive scheme (Seoul, 2016d). First, the city seeks to improve citizens’ accessibility to public transport. The Seoul Urban Railway Comprehensive Enhancement Strategy proposes to build two additional subway lines to connect the districts that are currently outside the catchment area.\",\"The main strength of the PTAL approach is that it is easy to understand. Unlike more sophisticated modelling approaches, PTAL allows for direct data visualisation using a contour map, where patterns of public transport provision are clearly shown (Figure 2). The formulae take into account the walking time from specified points of interest to all public transport service access points (SAPs), i.e. bus stops, rail stations, light rail stations, underground stations and Tramlink stops, within a defined distance threshold. This is combined with the average time a user must wait for the next service. Several parameters define the walk catchment area.\",\"The services included are those identified as the most important and essential for residents' day-to-day well-being (e.g. the nearest 10 000 low-qualified and high-qualified jobs, or the nearest three primary schools, secondary schools and further education institutions). This approach reveals users' ease getting to essential services while considering a degree of choice in the services to which they are likely to go (Inayathusein and Cooper, 2018). For instance, the highest score, A, means travel times to relevant destinations are more than one standard deviation below the average score, while E means travel times are more than two standard deviations above the average. It is particularly helpful when making decisions about the best places to introduce new services, such as health or education, with an aim to locate them in places with good connectivity.\",\"For instance, construction of the Elizabeth Line from Abbey Wood enlarges the catchment area and thus increases the number of reachable jobs. Rather than calculating travel times to specific locations, this method quantifies the number of services that can be reached within a given period (Inayathusein and Cooper, 2018). Such maps, for instance, those quantifying the number of workplaces reachable within 45 minutes by public transport for each zone in London, are used as a strategic indicator of connectivity in the Mayor's Transport Strategy. Projects potentially affecting the whole Greater London area, such as Crossrail 2 - the new rail link that will connect Central London to Reading and Heathrow in the west and Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east -, are assessed using London-wide catchment analysis to determine how many more services will be reachable within 45 minutes from each zone once service begins (Inayathusein and Cooper, 2018).\",\"One example of a comprehensive, national implementation of such a platform-enabled on-demand marketplace is FlexDanmark (see Box 1). This system builds on regulatory requirements to ensure health- and education-related accessibility across the country to create a nationally co-ordinated and optimised on-demand transport facilitated by a common IT platform. By centralising information on demand and creating a marketplace to provide flexible supply, it enables specialised trips (medical, school, etc.) For example, some operate fixed routes that are in-part crowd-sourced by users (e.g. Chariot - see Figure 2) and others offer services where riders are directed to pop-up stops within defined geographic areas.\",\"The limited amount of information provided so far by the government on access to the NAICM refers mostly to adjustments to road infrastructure and construction of toll roads. Public transport works planned include only extensions of two Metrobus lines and connection to underground lines that currently operate over capacity. The airport’s planning process should acknowledge clear objectives to generate high shares of travel on public transport.\",\"Additionally, LADOT has piloted a mobile payment application for its transit services and there are plans to expand Go LA to include reservation and payment capabilities in Summer 2016. Infrastructure as a Service more transparently reflects the costs to build, maintain and operate public infrastructure by charging fees for this service. With a solid data baseline, this approach can also support tiered fees to ensure there is equity in access to the public right-of-way. Infrastructure as a Service can help shift behaviour by incentivising shared mobility, promoting staggered commute times and other active transportation alternatives.\",\"Avoid” or “reduce” the need to travel and the trip length, by improving the efficiency of the overall transport system through integrated land-use planning and transport demand management, e.g. through compact, mixed-use development planning, traffic restrictions, mobility management and marketing, and national subsidies for low-carbon transport metropolitan design and planning. Shift” or “maintain” tools, to improve trip efficiency by encouraging modal shift to low-carbon transport modes such as public transport, e.g. through parking restrictions, road space allocation, public awareness campaigns on alternatives to private vehicles, procurement of public transport. Improve” fuel and vehicle efficiency and technologies, e.g. through vehicle standards, speed limits, labelling of vehicles’ environmental performance and fiscal incentives for electric or hybrid vehicles.\",\"This indicator provides information regarding how efficiently people are being transported and is a common metric for measuring the efficiency for mobility systems. Some research also indicates that the efficiency of shared mobility services at optimising the movement of users while minimising that of vehicles is greater than previous point-to-point, on-demand mobility services (i.e. taxis). The capacity utilisation rate of UberX vehicles, for example, has been found to be an average of 38% greater than traditional point-to-point services in two large North American cities (Cramer and Kreuger, 2016). Preliminary indications also suggest that capacity utilisation in shared mobility networks is markedly higher in dense urban areas, indicating that higher density (of supply and demand) is correlated with higher efficiency.\",\"A method called “shoulder pricing” is used, which involves increasing the rate in steps every half an hour before the peak and decreasing it after the peak. Charges are relatively low: the maximum rate for cars is SGP 3 and SGP 2.50 to enter the central business district, but the traffic flow has appeared to be quite sensitive to the charge: short-term elasticities have been estimated to be in a range between 0 and -0.42 (Menon and Shin, 2004). The immediate effect of the introduction of ALS in 1975 was the reduction of car traffic entering the city centre during the morning peak hours by over 70%.\",\"There are exceptions to this rule, for example KCATA's use of the agency's unionised bus drivers for the Bridj pilot described in the previous section. They are also an important motivator for early action as they provide a tangible reason to act. But going forward, it is not clear that cost savings are either a sufficient motivation or even a major motivation for seeking better synergies between ride services and public transport - at least where there is a desire to improve mobility and access outcomes for as broad a group as possible. Under this framing of the question, the potential for ride services and other innovative mobility options to draw away riders from specific routes does not necessarily imply that overall ridership would drop. In fact, if core services are improved and the convenience of using public transport as part of a trip chain increases, then overall ridership may even increase. In the broader picture, adding a more convenient mobility choice into the mix may improve overall access and mobility outcomes even as it reduces the need to own a car.\",\"A third-generation bicycle-sharing programme, an electronic parking system, smart cards and traffic visualisation are being developed, although as of 2016, they were still in the pilot or design stage. Bandung could become “smarter” through the use of digital technologies to analyse traffic congestion and commuting flows. It could also develop smart city initiatives that target the energy sector (i.e., reduce energy consumption and increase the use of more renewable energy sources) (OECD, 2016).\",\"The majority (83%) were women. Evaluation showed that people felt that they had improved their skills in getting on and off the vehicles (which is considered as one most critical issue) and were more confident in using public transport. A good practice example for dealing with information in a sound way is a traveller information system on barrier-free travelling in Frankfurt and Berlin (Germany), the BAIM system: \\\"Barrierefreie OV-Information fur mobilitatseingeschrankte Menschen“ (barrier-free information for persons with mobility impairments).\",\"This has led some authorities to seek detailed data from companies that may or may not be requested from other mobility service providers - or car drivers - on the same markets. Recent investigation of this data for New York City, for example, shows mixed results as far as the impact of ride services at an early stage of their deployment in that city (see Box 2). For this reason, some authorities are actively trialling partnerships with ride-sourcing companies in order to both lower the cost of public transport provision and to improve mobility outcomes for those who cannot, or choose not to, drive cars.\",\"Gangwong is a top performer in safety and access to services compared to other selected OECD TL2 regions (Figure 1.13). Approximately 97.2% of the region’s households had a broadband connection. Moreover, the region had about 4.5 percentage points lower unemployment rate than the average of selected OECD TL2 regions.\",\"Riders noted that the service was attractive because it was less expensive than alternatives. Survey evidence six months into the pilot found that riders used the service instead of a car trip (~30%), a bus trip (~30%) or a ride service (in this case, Uber - ~22%) (Marshall, 2017, Shaheen et al., Following on the demise of Kutsuplus, the closure of Bridj, which had been highlighted as one of the more innovative start-ups in the ride-service and public transport field, underscores the difficulty that app-enabled on-demand micro-bus shared ride services face at present.\",\"Importantly, bike sharing allows the BRT to attract passengers from a wider radius, making affordable mobility available to more residents. With bike docks at every station, the system also allows passengers who would ordinarily only travel one or two stops on the BRT to instead take a bike, saving the user money and alleviating BRT crowding. Reflecting the lack of alternative transport options, vehicles registered in Lahore increased sharply from 95 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2001 to 238 vehicles in 2008, resulting in an estimated 8 million motorized trips on a usual weekday.\",\"In particular, both central and local governments are focusing on reducing reliance on cars, sometimes adopting a “road diet” approach, and promoting public transport and soft mobility. For example, the approach of reducing road lanes and parking space is applied drastically in Sejong, Korea's most recently created city (see detailed profile in Chapter 3). Implementing such a vision requires a holistic approach to the metropolitan area’s development. Well-integrated transport, spatial and economic policies have contributed to making it possible for 90% of morning journey's to be by public transport or non-motorised modes (TfL, 2015).\",\"The rear plate of a driver who has no transponder, fails to insert his cash card into the transponder, or fails to maintain a cash balance sufficient to pay a particular charge, is automatically photographed as it passes under a gantry. Such drivers originally had to pay a fine of SGD 70, but now pay an administrative charge of SGD 10. The charges at the central business district cordon apply on working days during daytime hours (7.30 a.m.-7 p.m.), but there are periods with zero charges (10 a.m.-noon). On other roads, charges apply during the morning peak period (7.30 a.m.-9.30 a.m.) and in some locations in the evening (5.30 p.m.-8 p.m.). The ERP system makes it possible to vary charges by location, time of day and vehicle type, so as to relate them to the actual level of congestion. The rates for different types of vehicles are set to be approximately proportional to their passenger car equivalent (PCE) values.\",\"However, there are concerns that people who have long been accustomed to driving might stick to their old habits. In particular, pull factors alone are often not enough because the door-to-door convenience that only private vehicles can offer may be too attractive unless the disadvantages of driving are felt more acutely. Another factor of complexity stems from the fact that Suwon is part of the functional urban area of Seoul (according to the OECD methodology), which requires collaboration across administrative boundaries.\",\"The City of San Clemente subsidises the difference until the approximately USD 100 000 budget allocated for this pilot is exhausted. Additional sources of revenue for the programme are being explored by both Lyft and OCTA to extend the pilot's duration. The programme requires using the Lyft app on a smartphone but since not all Orange County residents own a smartphone or have an adequate data plan, City officials will help qualifying residents purchase government subsidised smartphones.\",\"Platform-mediated ADA vehicle requests also enable the pooling of adapted vehicles across multiple suppliers. The potential increase in efficiency and improvement in wait times and other outcomes are what motivated MBTA to pilot its RIDE service with Lyft and Uber in the first place. This ensures that specific initiatives, measures and partnerships contribute to shared and clearly articulated outcomes.\",\"At the same time it poses clear risks to the provision of equitable and sustainable mobility for all. Nonetheless, they are starting to have an impact of trip-making behaviour where they are present and are starting to be seen as a potential complement for first and last mile connections. In low density regions difficult to service with public transport and areas where public transport is available but quality is perceived to be lacking, ride services may also come to be seen as an alternative. Most of these initiatives are taking place in the United States - partly because of the popularity of ride services there, partly because many urban areas there have difficulty providing attractive public transport. Many of the partnerships described in this report are pilot projects or promotional campaigns and at present there is no evidence for a permanent shift in public transport service delivery towards structural partnerships with ride services. Nonetheless, authorities and ride-service operators are using these pilots to test new ways of improving mobility outcomes where it is difficult to provide quality public transport.\",\"In addition, the annual growth rates of GDP (2002-09) of the three metropolitan cities of Busan (6.9%), Incheon (7.1%) and Ulsan (7.0%) are higher than the national average (6.5%). A similar growth pattern among local cities can also be observed. Interestingly, energy consumption on transport increased by 10.10% between 1980 and 2009, whereas building energy consumption decreased by about 20% over the same period (Figure 1.16). Moreover, the share of energy consumption by the road sector is the highest among transport modes and rose steadily from 1990 to 2009 (Figure 1.17).\",\"These systems are becoming more popular globally and in the region, similar congestion pricing systems are being planned or considered in other large Emerging Asian cities, including Beijing and Jakarta. While the number of vehicles entering the city each day in Singapore increased by 22.1%, from 246 000 to 300 400, between 2004 and 2014, average speeds on expressways and arterial roads remained mostly unchanged and within their target ranges (Table 2.8). However, the design and pricing of these systems can create unintended consequences.\",\"Together with the reduction of subsidies for public transport, this has resulted in deteriorating service quality and a dysfunctional, fragmented transport market and system. Today, the city of Krasnoyarsk alone counts almost 100 private transport businesses, in addition to several municipal public transport companies, operating buses on various routes in the city (Krasnoyarsk, 2013b). Such factors are not unique to Krasnoyarsk, but they have a particular impact on congestion there because it is a regional transport hub in its own right and it straddles a major river.\",\"Because it catalogues where these partnerships have been deployed, it focuses largely on North American examples where many of these pilot programmes have been initiated. Examples include Lyft (and Uber, at the outset) offered as an option in Los Angeles Department of Transport Go LA app designed by Xerox and in the Dallas Area Rapid Transit trip planning app. These initiatives are analogous to those offered by several commercial third-party routing apps described in Chapter 2.\",\"For example, a Capital Area Traffic Center was founded in 2005 with the objective to facilitate consultations on metropolitan transport matters between Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi. The centre is composed of 48 members (19 representatives from Seoul, 18 from Gyeonggi and 11 from Incheon) and operates with a common budget based on contributions from the three local governments. One of the most representative projects is the metropolitan artery express bus rapid transit (BRT) links. However, the role of the centre is limited to BRT construction\\u002foperation and conducting National Household Travel Surveys.\",\"During the trial, in 2006, traffic volumes within the controlled area fell by approximately 20%, while public transit ridership increased by some 6 to 9% (Pike, 2010). The initial public view of the system had been negative, with a disapproval rate of 55%, but following the trial period this had changed to 53% taking a positive view. This shift took place in a context where the area involved was extensive - some 34 square kilometres - and where a modest charge could nevertheless add up significantly: vehicles entering at one of 17 charging pints would pay up to 20 Swedish Krona SEK, roughly USD 3, with a daily maximum of 60 SEK and daily passes available.\",\"It is also consistent with the results of recent OECD research, which showed a strong positive relationship between the amount of developed land per capita and the number of cars per 100 residents (see Annex 1.A2).5 However, Korea’s motorisation rate is below what many European countries, the United States and Canada registered at comparable income levels (Figure 1.6). It also remains one of the lowest in the OECD (Figure 1.7). This is likely the result of a comparatively efficient public transport system, coupled with population densities that allow for widespread use of public transport, which indicates bus and rail hereinafter except some cases including the national public transport master plan in Table 1.1. Korea’s low motorisation rate relative to its income level bodes well for its capacity to prevent further congestion and to enhance ecological sustainability.

In addition, better connections between bicycle lanes will be needed if this type of infrastructure is to develop into a useful network for bicycle users (Figure 3.2, right-hand panel). There are a growing number of bicycle parking facilities throughout the city, including in underground, Metrobus and trolley bus (zero-emission corridor) stations.\",\"The recommendation of the Center for Transit-Oriented Development (CTOD) to expand housing opportunities near transit provides useful insights into establishing a comprehensive TOD strategy in Korea. Strategies proposed by the CTOD include: i) identify and utilise opportunities for TOD, ii) provide incentives for mixed-income market response, iii) remove regulator}' barriers to higher density and transport plans and investments, iv) improve local capacity and partnership (Center for Transit-Oriented Development, 2007). This includes examining which portion of regional housing growth can be located around transit-accessible locations, and providing transit service to under-served areas.\",\"One good example of this type of plan is the city of Los Angeles' \\\"Urban Mobility Plan in a Digital Age\\\" that re-orients the focus to Mobility as a Service. Where frequent accessible buses and on-street hail taxis are available, licensed ride services must not erode overall levels of accessible transport. App-based ride services can improve overall accessibility by better matching supply of accessible vehicles and demand - but only if the design of the service and of the partnership takes into account the specific needs of travellers with impairments. By undertaking inventories of existing public transport routes to examine the potential for alternative service delivery models, public authorities and public transport operators can evaluate where synergies with innovative mobility services are strongest.\",\"Taken together, the incentive programmes - at a relatively modest fiscal outlay, and with clear benefits both fiscal and environmental - have substantially increased the proportion of e-bike usage throughout Austria. It is estimated that traffic congestion in Ho Chi Minh City is costing the city about VND14 billion a year which is roughly 6.25% of the city’s GDP (ESMAP, 2014). Fiscal measures such as vehicle licencing fees, parking charges and congestion charges are effective to shifting the cost of car usage more fully to vehicle owners.\",\"Probably not, and therefore cycling as a mode for senior citizens should also be considered, particularly now that the electrical bicycle has come about to cover greater distances. Certain subgroups need special attention, namely subgroups which are growing (oldest old, older women and persons living in single-households), those which appear especially disadvantaged and at risk of social exclusion (e.g. low income groups, rural residents), and those for which both criteria apply (e.g. ethnical minorities). Increasing women’s confidence and experience in driving in order to keep them safe and mobile implies a strong need for future research.\",\"Quasitransportation programmes should be introduced to regions where it is difficult to operate transportation system. In case of island areas, more than one round-trip passenger ship should be operated per day. In Korea, dong districts are termed urban areas while eup and myeon districts are classified as rural areas.\",\"A benchmark that measures levels of access could be applied to evaluate the links between access to opportunities and social development in cities. This target, aiming to \\\"provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all\\\", is supported by the infrastructure-based indicator 11.2.1, measuring the proportion of the population with convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (UN, 2016). This indicator is based on the assumption that access to infrastructure relates to access to opportunities. While it is useful, measuring and tracking progress in achieving SDG 11, as well as other SDGs (e.g. SDG 4.3, \\\"ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university\\\"), could be enhanced by incorporating other indicators that measure access to jobs, health and education via motorised and non-motorised modes (OECD, forthcoming).\",\"This section turns to literature and experts' discussions to explore these questions. The problem of the term's conceptual ambiguity in European policy making was identified during research for the COST Action \\\"Accessibility instruments for planning practice in Europe\\\" (Silva and Larsson, 2018). Silva and Larsson explain that \\\"accessibility\\\" is often used without definition or given a connotation that is quite different from the term's meaning in a transport context: the ease of reaching destinations or activities distributed in space.\",\"Countries and cities of the region could focus attention on utilizing these resources for actual application and implementation. A broad coalition of development partners to support regional cities in implementing sustainable urban transport master plans would be a step in the right direction. An example of this approach is the Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative18 of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the objective of which is to enable leaders to plan and implement sustainable mobility concepts. Depending on the need for travel, a journey usually involves more than one mode of transport. The integration of urban transport modes is essential to promoting smooth intermodal transfer. When there are two operators of different transport systems, integrated ticketing makes it more efficient as well as convenient for users, and many cities are now following this approach.20The physical interface between modes, infrastructure and facilities at intermodal junctions should allow smooth transfer of passengers and goods from one mode to another.\",\"Yet at the same time it poses clear risks to the provision of equitable and sustainable mobility for all. These risks include replacing well-understood business models and the regulatory framework governing them with a greater reliance on services whose business models are in flux and whose long-term financial robustness is not yet proven. There is also a risk that a shift in service from traditional public transport to ride services could lead to a loss of travel options for those with mobility impediments since ride services currently do not face the same accessibility requirements as public transport. Other risks could include increased congestion and environmental degradation and an erosion of equitable access opportunities.\",\"In some cases, this reduction even leads shared taxis to be cheaper than current public transport. Finally, the work tests the impact of a change in the market structure regarding the dispatcher of shared mobility systems. Specifically, having three centralised dispatchers and no interaction between shared taxis and taxi-buses causes a 15% drop in the performance of shared mobility services.\",\"In the urban core and surrounding districts, a balance must be stmck between efficient land use through mixed-use development of housing, public and commercial facilities, and compact development that respects factors such as building winds, a right to sunlight and residents’ health. In peripheral areas, better access to urban cores and low-density development can be achieved through public-transit system and pedestrian-friendly urban design (Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, 2007).

Since 2010, “people first” aspires to integrate pedestrians, cyclists and motorised vehicles on Seoul’s roads. The policy concept evolved to include a wider range of modes of transport with the aim to create more attractive alternatives to car use.\",\"Migration from public transport translates to increased mileage even if the trips are shared. Nonetheless, the correlation the report observes with the rise of ride services and a decline in public transport ridership may not necessarily be a causal one as there are other potential explanatory factors. These other confounding factors include the drop in gas prices since 2013, which has a well-documented statistical relationship with transit ridership and an increase in the prevalence of public transport delays in the city over this period.\",\"The congestion charge, increasingly applied in various metropolitan areas, has been shown to reduce congestion considerably, ranging from a 14% reduction in Milan (over 2008), 15% in London (2002-2003) and Singapore (1998) and 22% in Stockholm (January-July 2006) (Beevers and Carslaw, 2005, Olszewski, 2007, Milan municipality, 2009, Johansson et al. Not only did it create a cordon for vehicles entering the central city or the central business district, as is the case in London, Stockholm, Milan and several other cities, but it has also implemented congestion charges on expressways that are not in the central city, which Toronto might also consider. At present, there are 48 of these gantries: 30 form a cordon around the central business district, 13 others are located on selected expressway segments and five on radial arterial roads.\",\"In Mauritius, housing development for the economically less- advantaged population groups has increased the proportion of homeowners to 93 per cent in rural areas and 83 per cent in urban regions.

Data and methodology for this indicator are not available.\",\"They can also potentially reflect individual characteristics if the data used are differentiated accordingly (e.g. by number of jobs available to people in a certain age range or income group). For instance, while transport planners tend to focus on the transport component of accessibility, urban planning practice has often placed more emphasis on metrics reflecting land use factors. Practice has shown that breaking this silo-type of thinking promotes a more holistic approach and could be achieved by using a combination of indicators and conducting coordinated analysis by relevant authorities.\",\"In most (temporary) initiatives reviewed here, much of the risk is borne by the contracting public agency or authority. While there may be some debate on just how profitable different ride service models are, the services they provide in conjunction with public transport options remains a minuscule part of their overall costs. In some cases operators do invest in dedicated services and facilities as Lyft has done in order to provide or pay for call centres. These costs are covered by the ride services.\",\"While the reform in Seoul had undeniable positive outcomes, these also came with a cost. According to an analysis carried out by KOTI, public expenses related to the bus system were multiplied by two to five in Seoul, Daejeon and Daegu between the year before the reform and the first year after the reform. In particular, the city of Seoul had to spend KRW 2.3 trillion in bus subsidies during the first decade following the reform and the amount is increasing each year. However, it is difficult to distinguish to what extent such positive or negative outcomes are attributable to the bus system reform itself.\",\"Seoul is indisputably the most affluent and the most autonomous subnational government in Korea, with a financial independence rate (calculated as the percentage of local own resources over total budget) of 75%, which is by far the highest rate among subnational governments in Korea. The bars do not equal 100% due to a number of possible reasons: when there was no response, when the government voluntarily eliminated some responses to protect individuals’ privacy, and when the Census automatically eliminates records if the number of responses collected in the investigation area is less than five (to eliminate outliers). It ranks first among Korean TL3 regions in terms of road length (5 022 m\\u002fkm2 compared with a national average of 0.28 m\\u002fkm2), the number of train stations (320, including 257 subway stations), railway length (701 m\\u002fkm2) and subway line length (532.7 m\\u002fkm2, far above second-ranked Busan with 122.9 m\\u002fkm2 and third-ranked Daegu with 57.5 m\\u002fkm2) in 2010 (KOTI, 2016, Kostat, 2016a). The combined modal share of public transport and non-motorised modes is almost 77% (see Figure 3.1).\",\"These types of operators are governed directly by regional\\u002flocal transport authorities who define the level of service, fares and coverage. In some instances, national authorities also set requirements for these operators, especially in return for payments and subsidies. However, this model may harbour some inherent tensions in that officially partnering with innovative mobility operators, especially those that have limited or no public service obligations, may be seen as running counter to the agency mission. This is one of the reasons the US Federal Transit Administration has issued guidance on the matter.\",\"In lower income groups, women may have lower access to bicycle both due to lower ownership of vehicles as well as inequality amongst men and women in households. Men have the 'first right' over the vehicle owned by households. Lower use of public transport by low income women is also due to cost implications of public transport.\",\"But despite growing popularity and increasing recognition of the potential benefits of an accessibility-based approach, governments face the challenge of developing accessibility-based decision-making frameworks i.e. policy, planning and investment frameworks in which accessibility considerations are central criteria systematically guiding decisions. This report examines how accessibility indicators can support such a shift. Figure 1 summarises this transition and highlights the weak and imperfect link between physical movement and the objectives of overall well-being and sustainability.\",\"Overall, Korean cities have been developed in a physically compact way, without adequate consideration of urban amenities, including walkability, public transport, socio-economic networks and environmental sustainability. The process of rapid urbanisation has tended to neglect the provision of green spaces in cities, while prioritising economic growth. Furthermore, a study of urban forms reveals different priorities across and within cities.\",\"This problem is also complemented by the overpriced and inefficient private parking spaces that exist. There are also 15,000 temporary parking places that can accommodate 191,500 cars. For example, Polotsk city’s mobility plan, currently under development, envisages the integrated development of different urban mobility modes and the optimization of transport routes (box 13.5).\",\"In particular, FTA makes the distinction between \\\"shared-ride\\\" service and \\\"exclusive ride\\\" service. The former are services where open sharing of the ride occurs by design and passengers or drivers cannot limit who comes on board if there is capacity, conditioned on certain operational, safety or security considerations. Ride services which can be reserved for the exclusive use of individuals or private groups, either by the operator or the first passenger's refusal to permit additional passengers, are considered exdusive-ride services (FTA, 2017). Generally, exclusive ride services are not eligible for funding through Federal grant programmes (with some limited exceptions where the exclusive ride service is part of a specific programme supporting alternatives to public transport - like some job access programmes).\",\"The longer walking and bicycle trips on roads without any dedicated facilities for theses modes increase the risk of getting involved in a fatal crash. The current relocation policies increase the vulnerability of the current vulnerable road users. The land use policies must ensure that especially the poor households, who cannot afford any form of motorized travel, are located close to employment opportunities resulting in short travel distances.\",\"Available Monday through Friday from 5:30 to 19:00, the pilot sought to increase ridership on the light rail system and decrease car use for accessing the rail station or driving to Denver. The programme is currently (Spring 2017) under evaluation having run its initially planned course. Bus service was costly in those areas and in August 2016 LA VTA shut down an underperforming bus line1 with an eye to replacing it with ride-sourcing and taxis.\",\"However, the understanding of sustainability will require revisiting the interpretation of lower mobility in view of the requirements of sustainable development and sustainable transport. Empowerment of women will have to come through enhanced accessibility to various opportunities without dependence on motorized mobility. Adverse effects are in the form of poor air quality, risk of traffic crashes, lack of activity leading to obesity and other life style related diseases. Least adverse effects on users and non-users is possible when majority city residents have to travel short distances thus reducing the exposure to air pollution as well risk from traffic crashes.\",\"The important aspect is that the mode cannot be perceived as inferior compared to car, since in that case the downward move would not be achieved or it would be negligible only. A research10 about Australian, European and North American cities on congestion relief from high quality public transport suggests that it is valued at an average of $0.45 (Aus$2008) per marginal public transport-vehicle km of travel, if both travel time and vehicle operating costs are considered. The relief can span however from $0,044 to $ 1.51 with higher values for urban areas or rather urban traffic corridors with greater degrees of traffic congestion. Furthermore, the combined benefits of rail and bus transport significantly exceed total public transport subsidies. Overall, if these passengers were not transported by public transportation systems they would have contributed an additional delay of almost 865 million hours or about a 15 per cent increase in the total delay.\",\"Concentrating urban growth along high-capacity transit corridors and establishing transit nodes is increasingly being recognised as a way to moderate climate change and increase the mobility of low-income residents (Cervero and Dai, 2014). In this, Cuernavaca is not alone. It is a common challenge for many cities in the southern hemisphere to be historically dominated by a quasi-informal network of privately-owned transport operators that are resistant to new public operators (Flores Dewey, 2013).\",\"For example, drivers may be offered the option of slower, free lanes or faster lanes with tolls. Each pricing system has evolved out of a different uiban context and philosophy. The spatial structure of European cities tends to be monocentric and sometimes radial, with a “natural” boundaiy, and are more likely to introduce a cordon, or corridor around the urban area, while typical US cities are polycentric and are based on a grid structure. Another reason for the difference in pricing systems lies in different perspectives on congestion fees.\",\"First built in Ulsan in 1960s, industrial complexes, totalling 1,074 across the country has significantly contributed to the Korea’s industrialisation and economic growth to date. The investment in building industrial complexes was followed by heavy investment in infrastructure, particularly in transport such as expressway networks and rapid-transit railway (KTX). While the central government support had been focused on large scale complexes usually located in cities, since the 1980s agricultural and industrial complexes have also received the government support as ways of revitalising small and medium-sized cities and regions.\",\"First, Korea’s urban challenges are examined, as well as economic, social and environmental trends in general. As one way to address these challenges, the details on why urban form matters and how they can be measured will follow in the second section. The sheer speed of industrialisation and urbanisation since the 1960s resulted in extensive economic achievements, but also left significant urban challenges.\",\"The logic is that most customers of a place providing a service (e.g. a shop, school or hospital) will come from its catchment area. As with travel time mapping, analysis can be conducted for different public transport modes. Such analysis can show how many more jobs can be reached by looking at how a plotted area changes if a new transport route is introduced.\",\"A better-designed approach could help win support from the city government and citizens. Diverse approaches to congestion pricing, including value pricing and area pricing, could be examined with a view to diversifying congestion fees in Korea, reflecting the characteristics of different urban development patterns (Boxes 2.20 and 2.21). The United Stales, by contrast, charges congestion fees by value pricing for travellers on a particular segment of a facility.\",\"Such studies highlight the potential of'smart card' data analysis in providing operators with maximum value for their infrastructure investments. It appears that the growing mobility needs of the elderly and people with disabilities, combined with diminishing public finances requires investment prioritisation in areas that could provide the greatest benefits to users. The factors, and their interactions, affecting transport accessibility for individuals, as well potential policy\\u002factivity outcomes (abandon, reschedule, relocate and replace) are summarised in Figure 3.10. Participation in global supply chains is essential for attracting foreign investment and enterprises as well as human capital.\",\"While the term is mostly interchangeable with “green transport” or “sustainable transport”, the former tends to draw more attention to types of transport modes, and the latter to the comprehensive impact of transport across environment, economy and society. An additional message that “eco-mobility” conveys is the cultural aspect of transport. It interprets roads not as an exclusive property of cars, but as a recreational space.\",\"For instance, the ITF's proposed benchmark makes it possible to combine information on the levels of access to services by different transport modes with data on income distribution of an urban population. This type of analysis sheds light on the link between income inequality and access to opportunities in urban areas. Similarly, this approach has potential for analysing links between transport accessibility and greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector.\",\"Co-location is another approach that seeks to build demand. Basic overhead costs - energy, security and administrative expenses - can be pooled, generating economies of scope. If post office services are consolidated with a shop, people can obtain their mail and purchase food in one trip. Finally, service merger takes similar or substitute services and combines them into a single entity.\",\"This task is particularly urgent as the greatest population growth will be in cities in developing countries where significant urban transport challenges already exist (see section 3.3.1 below). Such challenges are particularly pronounced in developing countries where strong migration to urban areas and increased private motorization fuelled by strong economic growth, are outpacing infrastructure development and the expansion and modernization of public transport systems. The process of achieving more sustainable urban transportation systems, designed with the principle of accessibility at their core, depends on the participation of all stakeholders in cities: the authorities, the private sector and the citizens, within the principles of democracy. A successful process will depend on effective governance of land use and transportation, where new housing and commercial planning will entail simultaneous transportation systems design, careful neighbourhood design, strategic infrastructure investments, and fair, efficient and stable funding (Kennedy et al.,\",\"It is also important to note that because ride-sourcing companies are currently more flexibly regulated than public transport and taxis in many markets, they are able to trial new services and business models — including some that have become quite popular, like commercial ridesharing. One reason for this is that ride service operators understandably want to preserve commercially sensitive and privacy-eroding data - especially in light of the obligations that some public authorities have to make public data they hold. Ride service companies have faced calls for detailed data release that they have sometimes accepted. At least one company, Uber, has created an on-line tool, Movement, allowing registered users to access some of the data Uber collects. One exception to the general rule of limited data sharing by ride services is New York City, where the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) compels ride services to provide detailed data analogous to the data that taxis and other traditional ride services must provide.\",\"Based on app-ordered minibus services that optimised routes in real-time, the service promised flexible, on-demand microtransit in central Helsinki at an attractive price for riders. Trips cost a base fee of EUR 1.50 plus an additional EUR 0.15 per direct-route kilometre (due to the nature of the service, actual service deviated from the direct route due to additional pick-ups and drop-offs). The project was the first of its kind bringing together microtransit and an app-enabled on-demand booking\\u002fpayment environment but ultimately was not renewed in 2016 due to uneconomic performance linked to two design flaws.\",\"No common rules of operation, studies for corridor planning or evaluation procedures for BRT exist for the ZMVM as a whole.

The main purpose of comparing CYTAL and PTAL is to highlight areas where PTAL is low by itself but can potentially be raised by including cycling as an access mode. This measure, however, does not take into account the availability of cycling infrastructure, such as parking at origin or destination, or the suitability of the cycle network for a given trip. Thus, this indicator serves TfL for strategic cycling analysis and helps identify areas for potential future cycling infrastructure investment in the Greater London Area. Most importantly, such analysis requires additional quality data on availability of cycling infrastructure, including parking and dedicated cycling lanes, and on perceived safety and overall convenience of cycling in various areas across London. However, they do not capture the actual accessibility needs of various groups of people.\",\"For example, residents have voluntarily been enforcing a car-free day per month on a few selected streets in the neighbourhood. This raises a number of issues, such as congestion, the risk of road accidents, a lack of parking space and potential loss in quality of life due to congestion. Suwon is gradually expanding its subway network to provide its citizens with alternative modes of transport.\",\"The convergence of and co-ordination among services, business models and disparate actors in today's rapidly evolving mobility landscape may lead to a situation where consumers no longer purchase and use vehicles or depend solely on providers of traditional public transport services to get around. Perhaps more telling is that 9 out of 15 of the world's largest automobile manufacturers (and four out of the top five) have announced a new focus on \\\"mobility services\\\" rather than depending only, or sometimes even principally, on vehicle sales and maintenance. In some cases, manufacturers have stated that a shift to selling mobility services to consumers will gradually become their core strategic focus (e.g. Ford, Daimler, PSA). Other companies beyond the automotive industry have announced visions that centre on rolling out fleets of shared and perhaps automated vehicles that will obviate the need for car ownership in many cities (e.g. Lyft, Uber and Waymo).\",\"It is likely that as each generation reaches old age, it will face similar difficulties as the pace of technology moves faster than people's ability to stay ahead of it mentally and physically. Given the likely increase in prevalence of digital interfaces - especially in the context of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) - designing services that are accessible for as wide a population as possible will become a core concern. This is already the case for Finland, a pioneer in MaaS policy and deployment (see Box 5). Over the past 30 years, in North America, Europe and elsewhere there have been developments, initiated by the civil rights movement and increasingly enshrined in law, to require all public transport to be designed and operated by vehicles and systems accessible to people who use wheelchairs, have walking difficulty, impaired sight or hearing, etc.\",\"In term of place cs variation is more flat and is within the interval of 40toalmost 300 places per lOOOf with the mean of some 130 and a median of 120 places.

In general, cities that offer relatively high total place capacity have also a relatively high number of circulating buses during the peak hours.\",\"Mobility Management is a concept to promote sustainable transport and manage the demand for car use by changing travellers” attitudes and behaviour. This can be done by full-service agencies spreading information and also providing possibilities to choose a suitable and sustainable alternative to private car use (Project 13). Sustainable modes can also be favoured by using economic policy instruments like road tolls, congestion taxes, and taxes on motor vehicles.\",\"A common error is using \\\"accessibility\\\" and \\\"mobility\\\" interchangeably. Doing so reinforces the development of policies based on indicators focusing on physical movement.

By eliciting users' unmet needs, the indicator also served to identify the transport user groups (that are particularly vulnerable due to limited accessibility to activities. With 62% of retirees assessing their satisfaction negatively, analysis showed that retirees' need to reach health facilities by public transport is largely unmet, while 53% of housewives feel their need to do daily shopping is unsatisfied.\",\"One shortcoming is that they do not incorporate a land use component and so provide no information on the interaction of transport and land use. These indicators can potentially include the individual and temporal component by measuring access at a particular time for a particular social group. Additionally, infrastructure-based indicators tend to disregard the equity and distributional and justice effects of accessibility and thus are less suitable for social evaluations in the form of equity-based analysis.\",\"In this case, alternative risk mitigation structures may be necessary on the public side. Innovation management is not limited to efforts seeking to reconfigure the provision of mobility services, it is something public agencies are facing across a broad spectrum of fields including broadband access, water services and housing, for instance. In these instances, it may be worthwhile to think about alternative structures that enable sustainable risk-taking in public governance. These firms invest in a broad range of potential new businesses with the expectation that many will fail -sometimes quickly, lessons will be learnt and incorporated into new business models and eventually, a sufficient number of ideas take hold and generate adequate returns to sustain and grow the overall portfolio value.\",\"Women generally have complex trip-making patterns that extend beyond the pendular commute trip. Public transport, especially in low-density urban and suburban areas, may not provide as convenient a service as cars in those instances. Many low-income workers are employed in the service sector, manufacturing jobs or in part-time employment.\",\"Walking accessibility should be improved, with especial consideration for accessibility for persons with disabilities. Transport strategy will need to be further developed and, if streets become narrower, the currently successful public transport system will need to be extended and improved. Green spaces should be multi-functional: accessible to citizens, protection from noise, purification of air, and help in lowering extremely high temperatures.\",\"Making transportation inclusive means also ensuring the affordability of accessible transportation. Accessible ICTs, including mobile applications, government websites, public kiosks and automated teller machines, should be part of accessible urban development plans. Although compact cities can offer enormous potential for persons with disabilities, this potential will not materialize unless accessibility and nondiscrimination are prioritized.\",\"As they steadily cut fares, TNCs are erasing these longstanding financial disincentives for traveling by motor vehicle in Manhattan. The report suggests that if TNC growth continues at the current pace (and it finds there is no sign of it levelling off), the necessity of some type of road pricing will become more and more evident. These function are much like ride-sourcing services except that they match multiple, unrelated individuals or parties to share the same vehicle over the course of the same ride.\",\"In the interest of effective transport planning, it is important to measure the theoretical walkability of an environment based on geographic indicators, the amount of walking activity that is actually undertaken, as well as the perceptions that people have regarding the feasibility and enjoyment of walking, as these factors strongly influence decisions to undertake trips on foot. Another challenge for transport planners is improving walking infrastructure and encouraging greater walking at the expense of individual motorised transport specifically, while maintaining or increasing the ridership and mode share of public transit options. This means making walking spaces more enjoyable and improving the connectivity of and ease of transfers between modes. It is important to recognise that greater walkability in cities will not be achieved one street at a time, but through comprehensive strategic planning in urban transport design regarding the location of places of employment, transport hubs, education sites, sports and leisure sites, health care sites, and retail locations.\",\"There is therefore a possibility that both losses and gains from the reform have been overestimated. In any case, cities that are financially worse off than Seoul or struggle with financial uncertainty may be advised to explore alternative models, such as introducing a tendering scheme for new and discarded routes, with the possibility to expand public ownership in the future. At the moment, in an attempt to further support the reforms carried out by city governments, the Korean government is initiating efforts to improve the transparency of bus operating systems.\",\"Coefficients of the utility function are predetermined for each TL3 area and provided in the guidelines. The resulting modal choice probabilities are then combined with O\\u002fD data to estimate total traffic volumes and compared to actual traffic volumes to ensure consistency of the model. After expected traffic volumes are determined, the monetary benefits are assessed.\",\"While in developed countries “Improve” strategies can help promote electric vehicles and rail electrifications, developing countries often make better use of encouraging small, efficient cars and innovations for traditional non-motorised transport modes such as cycle rickshaw's. Effective sustainable transport strategies often require enhancing synergies between “Avoid”, “Shift” and “Improve” policies. For example, when investing in a bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor (“Shift”), uiban policy makers can alter land-use regulations to promote densification around the corridor (“Avoid”), and use clean-fuel buses (“Improve”). A-S-I strategies require infrastructure investments, such as: BRT corridors (“Shift”), rail infrastructure for metros and high speed rail (“Shift”), parking (“Avoid”), and electric vehicle charging stations (“Improve”).The model is most applicable to the uiban context and to long-distance or international freight transport, where multiple transport modes and options are likely to be available. In rural areas, where options are often limited, “shifting” is less relevant, at least in the short term.\",\"Public subsidies to operators disproportionately cover these low frequency services in thin markets. Replacing these trips with less costly and possibly more convenient options could also free up public resources for other uses. According to the survey, car-sharing and ride-services were generally seen as competing more with taxi and private car use than with public transport. Even if there were, it would be difficult to generalise at this stage on how this impact, either positive or negative, might evolve as more and more people use ride services. But at present, there seems to be evidence that in certain contexts - especially where the provision of public transport services is expensive and quality is low -well-targeted policy to replace certain poorly-performing and expensive bus services may indeed increase the overall attractiveness of public transport. In these cases, public authorities and public transport operators can start to evaluate where these synergies are strongest by undertaking inventories of existing public transport routes and services to evaluate the potential for alternative service delivery models -including those based on co-operation with ride services.\",\"In addition, discounts are given to families and children while senior citizens, persons with a disability and children under six travel for free. Therefore, subsidies need to be designed in such a way that they are also affordable for public budgets while providing sufficient resources for long-term development of the public transport operator. Support for the informal transport sector requires only minor investments to improve aspects such as safety, accountability, driver conditions, and integration with the formal sector. The cycle rickshaw is a low cost and environmentally sustainable mode of transport for short trips. Able to integrate easily into other transport systems, the rickshaw can provide point-to-point service at a price within reach of low income earners. This recognition highlights and reiterates the view that road safety in many countries of the region is an important development issue, considering its magnitude and the gravity of the negative impacts of road accidents on the economy, public health and general welfare of the people, particularly the poor.\",\"The model then takes inputs for zone-to-zone travel times from any number of major travel demand models. The model can then be run iteratively to compare a range of combined transport and land-use consequences from various transport policy and investment scenarios. It is an integrated transport land-use model that has been applied in a number of regions to test alternative land development scenarios and transport policies.\",\"The first was that too few vehicles were deployed and the second was that the trial area was too large. Together, this meant that wait times were unacceptably long and the service never gained commercial traction (HSL, 2016). The dispatching algorithm and the app itself were seen as innovative and valuable and the IT-company behind both is still involved in other ride-service initiatives.\",\"With shorter journeys, they are more likely to walk. However, women have more complex journey patterns and are at a disadvantage when living in peripheral urban areas because of the poor frequency of public transport. People with disabilities suffer a wide range of issues when travelling, including obstructed and dangerous sidewalks.\",\"If the land use policies ensure that especially the poor households who cannot afford any form of motorized travel are located close to employment opportunities resulting in short travel distances. This will result in reducing the risk of fatal crashes because the distances and travel time will reduce in addition to increasing the accessibility to education, health facilities and employment opportunities. Level of service of an intersection is measured in terms of delay faced by the motorized traffic.\",\"This should be eased with the completion of the fourth bridge over the Yenisei, which is now under construction. Transport policies designed at different levels of government and implemented at different territorial scales cannot be considered in isolation. Regulatory, financial and administrative powers are clearly attributed to the different levels of government (Table 3.3), but policies are not always well co-ordinated and integrated.\",\"This is especially the case if travel to destinations includes transfers and significant waiting times. Public transport also provides basic mobility to those who may not have access to cars and whose travel requirements are not suited to walking or cycling. High-frequency, rapid and good quality public transport supply may compete with cars in terms of convenience, cost and overall user experience. It does so while decreasing per-passenger land-take, energy use and environmental impacts due to efficiencies derived from scale and electrification in the case of many rail, trolley and electric-powered bus systems.\",\"For instance, the Linz's (Austria) 'barrier-free travel (Ungehindert mobil) for individuals with special needs' project created a transport system friendly to individuals with special needs by a widespread installation of wheelchair ramps, designated spaces in public transport and ground markings to assist individuals with impaired vision, and the availability of public transport maps and timetables in Braille. In another example, an adequately equipped and staffed waiting room for people with impaired hearing was set up in the main train station of Dusseldorf (Germany) in 2007 (UNECE, 2012). Analysis of the challenges and efficiency of such efforts, as well as the dissemination of the lessons learned can provide valuable insights into the different approaches to improve transport accessibility.\",\"Integrating pedestrian and cyclist needs is therefore a key part of providing equitable and sustainable transport. The specific requirements of women - who often need to juggle a (non-paid) job at home and a (paid) job outside - are also not fully understood by planners. To drive change, the voice of those left behind has to be made heard, here, non-governmental organisations have an important role.\",\"Risk on the cost side for public agencies is also contained since most of the services to-date are time bound pilots with fixed budgets for subsidy payments - once the money runs out, so too does the service unless additional funds are allocated through the budget process. And the pilots typically allow public agencies and operators to enact sometimes substantial cost savings. Revenue estimates also oftentimes correctly assume a rise in ridership linked to the greater convenience and contained costs of services offered - especially in comparison to the pre-existing public transport-alone offer.\",\"First, however, particular surveys must be conducted to collect information that allows such analysis. The survey's questions on the extent to which people can travel without a car improved understanding of the user's perspective of public transport accessibility gaps. The DfT also refers to the UK's National Travel Survey, which asks questions about travel experience, in identifying where poor connectivity is a problem and in identifying areas where transport improvements must be prioritised (Cooper and Penrose, 2018).\",\"However, as taxi markets are increasingly disrupted by ride service companies, there is an increasing realisation that public transport may be next and that authorities must re-evaluate their stance on the whole mobility ecosystem in a unified and coherent manner. There are many reasons that this will not necessarily be straightforward, not least of which is that some see emerging mobility services, and ride services in particular, as increasingly competing in the same space as public transport (and potentially for certain pedestrian and cycling trips). This, if true, would certainly counter stated policy objectives for many public authorities and would require strong action to prevent such a loss. This framing of the question - ride services and public transport competing for a uniform, fixed and possibly even shrinking market, however, belies the reality in many cities.\",\"While there was a considerable upfront investment -equivalent to some USD 200 million in setting up the system, and some USD 300 million in buses, other transit options, and park-and-ride facilities - operating costs have proved to represent some 25% of annual revenues, rendering the investment cost-effective. Moreover, other benefits have been estimated on an annualised basis at some USD 85 million deriving from shorter travel times, USD 18 million from enhanced road safety, and USD 13 million from health and environmental benefits. Moreover, no effect was observed on the level of retail sales.\",\"No local government has competency in this area, as it is regulated by the federal government. Freight transport represents 14% of the transport fleet (700 000 freight vehicles are registered in the ZMVM), most of them highly polluting. Monitoring this sector is highly complicated and expensive (SEDEMA, 2012).\",\"Many countries also lack this capacity (Castro et al., The challenge is that such indicators require estimation of the total amount of travel with each transport mode within the city boundaries. Responsibility for this type of mobility data has traditionally been outside the remit of local government road safety teams, making it harder for road safety professionals to gain access.\",\"The degree to which the questions of the survey were answered by the authorities differs and hence it was not possible to analyze every element selected for review for the group of 32 or even 36 capital cities. United Nations Statistical Division database. Yet some data, like e.g. such necessary to examine the demand for motorized and non-motorized transport were estimated based on modal spilt information available for many of the cities of the European Union region32.\",\"In contexts where accessibility requirements impose that all public transport vehicles are accessible and public transport frequencies are high, a move to longer wait times for accessible ride service vehicles will represent a retrograde step. This would include both disability awareness training and job specific practical training in areas such as guiding a blind person, assisting a wheelchair user, understanding and supporting a person with dementia. These are the principles that guided the development of MBTA's RIDE pilot. Provided that vehicles were suitable and drivers were trained, they would mostly adapt without difficulty.\",\"The adjoining areas and buildings could include commercial facilities for shopping areas, hotels, office complexes, recreational facilities and restaurants. Interchange stations in Hong Kong, China as well as Tokyo and Seoul provide thriving examples of commercial and economic activities at such intermodal transfer terminals developed through value-capture. Greater Jakarta has developed a transport master plan based on this concept.\",\"Further detoils on the survey methodology con be found in Arvis el ol. ( A decade ago, a study of the impacts of low transport accessibility was carried out in the United Kingdom (Social Exclusion Unit, 2003). National and local initiatives were developed to deal with these issues, including increased funding for rural and urban bus services, integration of routes and new ticketing systems, as well as a transport schemes to support access to work (UNECE, 2012). In rural areas, investment forexpanding\\u002f upgrading the transport network is scarce, whereas, at the same time, expanding rural transport networks might have significant environmental impacts. In urban areas, the lack of space constrains expansion of and\\u002for structural changes in the transport network, moreover, the environmental and health impacts of an expanding urban transport network may be very significant.\",\"Connected, autonomous, shared and electric mobility will be necessary in order to decarbonise urban passenger transport. The shared nature of this mobility will be essential to meeting urban mobility needs. Comprehensive policy portfolios will include strategic land-use policies integrated with multimodal transport planning, economic instruments, infrastructure\\u002fservice measures, as well as regulatory measures that support connectivity. Successfully reducing the use of personal vehicles will ultimately depend on providing citizens with sufficiently attractive alternative mobility options.\",\"Well organized public transportation provides numerous benefits to communities and individuals by lowering the unit costs of transport and easing access to different locations. Public transportation helps to reduce congestion and delays, improving air quality and increasing productivity, i.e., less time is wasted in traffic congestion (Litman, 2014, Public Transport Victoria, 2014). Thus, better planning and integration of land-use planning with transportation planning is an important factor for sustainable urbanization. The SDG’s imperative to make cities more inclusive implies that cities need to move away from car-based travel to public and active modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling with good inter-modal connectivity.\",\"Singapore, however, has used cordon charges in its current ERP scheme since 1998, when it replaced the ALS, introduced in 1975. Under the ERP, cars entering the city centre are automatically charged as they pass through gantries into the city centre during peak hours. Rates are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis with the goal of maintaining speeds of 20 km\\u002fh to 30 km\\u002fh on arterial roads and 45 km\\u002fh to 65 km\\u002fh on expressways, and vary by vehicle size, entry point, day of the week and by half-hour period during peak hours.\",\"Traffic inside the LEZ is reduced under this scenario, and adequate transit services outside of the LEZ appear to be crucial in reducing the congestion that occurs at the transfer points between personal cars and shared mobility and public transport. In Helsinki, the LEZ significantly reduces congestion to a degree that is comparable to the scenario of full adoption of shared mobility over the whole study area. Adequate integration with the existing public transport system also mitigates local congestion effects. In Auckland and Helsinki, the electrification of the vehicle fleet is associated with a significant reduction in costs, whereas in Dublin this reduction is limited.\",\"The constructor (usually governmental bodies or private contractors in public-private partnerships) sets out the area that will be affected by the newly constructed transport infrastructure.

Experience in OECD countries suggests that strengthening economic appraisal procedures and eligibility criteria for subsidies could improve the cost-efficiency of transport projects. Social inclusion can also be reinforced through land-value capture mechanisms, targeted subsidies for the neediest users and reasonable fare levels.\",\"This perentage varies from less than 30 per cent in selected cities from developing countries to over 90 per cent among cities from more developed countries.

the third quarter of 2012 real house prices started to show signs of rebounding again and in 2013 price-to-income ratios were above their long-term average in many countries (Andre 2010, BIS Quarterly Review 2014), suggesting that housing affordability might be starting to decline once again (Appendix Figure B.7). These trends hide important variations across countries. In 2013 price-to-income ratios exceeded their long-term average by over 10 % and were still rising in Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom (OECD Housing Prices Database 2014', IMF Global Housing Watch 2014).\",\"Furthermore, taxation of residential, rental and social rental housing is excluded from this analysis because of limitations in the reported data.9 Overall, more work is needed to improve coverage and validate the quality of the data. The next sections provide more information on these policy instruments, on their coherence with social policy objectives and on the amount of resources invested in them. Owner-occupied housing is the dominant tenure across OECD countries (see Figure 1) and it received public support in all of the countries surveyed in OECD QuASH. The collected data show that multiple policy instruments are typically used to this end and generally include both demand-side and supply-side subsidies.\",\"However, buying urban and peri-urban property (housing land lots and flats) is an attractive investment for those who work abroad. Flat sales in Chisinau are growing 8% annually.64 This means that there is a growing demand for housing in the capital and in the immediate vicinities. However, the land is not yet used intensively. Chisinau, like most Moldovan cities, still has a lot of available land in developed blocks and some abandoned land lots. This non-intensive urban land use situation currently provides an opportunity for replacing, upgrading, and developing the physical infrastructure (e.g., utilities, transport), which is needed due to the growing demand for housing. With new constructions and land acquisition progressing, there is a need to have adequate spatial development plans in place.\",\"The combination of lack of fiscal incentives and development control has created a vicious circle leading to an unprecedented housing shortage and severe housing affordability crisis. To provide an order of magnitude of the effects of the development control system on housing markets, Hilber and Vermeulen (2016) estimate that housing prices would have increased 100% less between 1974 and 2008 in the absence of any regulatory constraints. These requirements usually consist in attributing land use type (residential, commercial, industrial, or mixed) to plots of land zoned for new construction and in defining the development intensity (in the form, for example, of floor to area ratios).\",\"Understanding the housing conditions of households is therefore crucial to assessing their level of wellbeing. In European OECD countries, for example, 36% of residents report feeling “heavily burdened” by the cost of housing (EU-SILC 2012). This is a sizeable 18% increase in the share of households that feel heavily burdened since before the Great Recession in 2007.\",\"In EU-SILC, countries are instructed to include a tenant's payment to a landlord (as well as any housing benefits paid directly to the owner or through the household). Note that housing allowances are included both in the numerator (rental costs) and in the denominator (income) in EU-SILC. When reporting rent, households report the total amount that is being paid to the landlord, including the transfer of a housing allowance.\",\"The bias toward home ownership is hardly unique to Kazakhstan, and in OECD countries as diverse as Mexico and the United States, most of the housing assistance supports home ownership (OECD, 2015b). Despite the shortage of housing in the country, the real estate market is full of housing for sale and rent that remain vacant. Interviews conducted for this review suggest that the population is generally unwilling to rent housing because of the unregulated market, high price of rentals, lack of legal certainty and for cultural reasons.\",\"Further analysis of similar initiatives might help governments learn from the experience of other countries. The private rental market also plays an increasingly important role in the provision of affordable housing, this is likely to continue as housing support shifts from social rental housing to housing allowances. Policies to support housing affordability through the private rental market are therefore becoming more prominent.\",\"Germany has not seen the same sharp increases in housing prices as the United Kingdom, where housing affordability is a major public concern. Low housing supply elasticities, due to restrictive land use, have been argued to be one of the major reasons for decreasing affordability of housing, especially in economically vibrant areas of the United Kingdom (White and Allmendinger, 2003). Moreover, there are additional challenges to uiban containment strategies.\",\"While there is a myriad policies that shape the urban form, this section takes a closer look at policy tools related to housing, transport and environmental policies. Access to housing is precisely reported as one of the five most important objectives of housing policy by all 26 OECD countries that took the recent Questionnaire on Affordable and Social Housing (QuASH) (OECD, 2014d), including 18 countries that explicitly mentioned improving the affordability of housing (Salvi del Pero et al., As documented in Chapter 2, people living in large cities are, on average, less satisfied than the national average (by 13.3 percentage points) with the affordability of housing. For example, national fiscal frameworks may make greenfield development more attractive to cities than infill development.\",\"The tenure categories are also slightly different, in particular the survey data used in Figure 2 do not estimate social rental housing bur rather subsidized housing, which includes all accommodations rented at a reduced rate, i.e. employer-subsidized housing and accommodations where rent is fixed by law (Box 1). Consequently, for many European countries, the share of households in the subsidized rental category presented in Figure 2 is larger than the actual share of households living in social rental housing. The share of owner-occupied dwellings is comparable between Figure 1 and 2.\",\"Rather, Latin American housing programmes tend to be based on individual entitlements to households for the purchase (and in some cases, construction) of an individual home. Few initiatives have conceived of housing development within a broader urban development context linking housing to employment opportunities, infrastructure development, and the provision of public services, public spaces and open space. Accordingly, housing policies in many Latin American countries have resulted in similar challenges for cities across the region: urban sprawl, congestion, infrastructure gaps and a high rate of vacant homes. Rojas argues that of the 19 services provided by a house, only 5 are provided by the structure itself, all others are provided at a larger scale: the sub-division, the neighbourhood, the city or national government (see table below).\",\"While the federal government began to incorporate housing quality and liveability concerns in its policies and programmes prior to 2013 - notably in terms of improved construction materials, the elaboration of a Certified Development initiative (Desarrollos Certificados, formerly Desarrolios Urbanos Integrates Sustentables [DUIS]), and incentives for green building - housing policy objectives meanwhile remained quantitative and focused on furnishing individual houses with basic equipment (e.g. piped water, drainage). As will be seen, programmes like DUIS (and now Desarrollos Certificados) in many cases paid insufficient attention to housing location and access to urban services and infrastructure (see Box 2.6). In a review of housing policies in Latin America focusing on the experiences of Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, Rojas (2014) finds that housing policies throughout the region have lacked a place-based approach and have been poorly co-ordinated with other policy domains affecting urban development (e.g. economic development, transport, etc.).\",\"Finally, it can help improve quality of life in reducing transport costs (both in time and money), given quicker and\\u002for shorter journeys. To support this, the Chilean government is buying some land for subsidised housing in more central locations to try to reduce segregation and improve the social mix (OECD, 2012b). The main subsidy for vulnerable groups (DS49) includes a viable-location component, if the subsidised house is located close to infrastructure and public transport facilities, and close to health and education services.\",\"Yet these policies - largely driven by quantitative objectives - came with high qualitative costs for the country’s urban development. Housing development had been identified as an integral component of the country’s development in previous National Development Plans (2001-2006, 2007-2012) and conceived as a question of ensuring housing in sufficient quantity at a minimum level of quality, particularly for populations in poverty and with lower incomes. Federal housing finance programmes, including subsidies for low-income populations offered by the National Housing Commission (Comision Nacional de Vivienda, CONAVI), the National Trust Fund for Popular Housing (Fondo Nacional de Habitaciones Populares, FONHAPO) and the Ministry of Social Development (Secretaria de Desarrollo Social, SEDESOL) and publicly backed mortgages offered by INFONAVIT, FOVISSSTE and others, have been integral in supporting the push to expand housing access.\",\"Since 2001, rapid population growth in large and mediumsized cities has led to a shortage of affordable housing for low-income residents, incoming migrants and even middle-class households. After the massive privatisation of housing in the 1990s, owner-occupancy is the dominant tenure in Kazakhstan, as it is in Eastern European and OECD countries. Given the extremely limited direct public provision of housing (including social housing), the private sector is best equipped to accommodate the rising demand for affordable housing in large cities.\",\"Despite the 2008 crisis, people continued to borrow money to buy houses, but only high-income groups are now able to afford them, given the high interest rates on mortgages, of 13%-15% in 2016. This has prevented many citizens from entering the real estate market. As a consequence, a growing percentage of home seekers from middle and low-income groups have registered for social housing.\",\"However, recipients of homeownership grants are constrained in their residential mobility not least because the subsidized dwellings cannot be sold for 5 years. The subsidy is designed as a rental voucher targeted at young families, i.e. people aged 18 to 30 living in households of at least 2 individuals. Eligibility is based on income, household composition and current housing conditions and targets households from the 2nd to the £\\u003eh decile of the income distribution.\",\"The element of inadequate housing would be reported separately. Housing affordability is affected by many factors including capital variables such as land, infrastructure and building materials, and occupational variables such as land leases, service costs and interest rates. However, when it comes to measuring affordability there are three common measures which fall into two components: housing costs and household income.\",\"In addition, housing vulnerability of applicants is currently not taken into account. Finally, the maximum housing price is quite high (2 000 UF, or more than 90 000 USD in the case of middle-income families) which makes applying attractive for better-off families (OECD, 2012b). The government has recently revised the system, criteria and reliability of the means proxy test (Ficha de Proteccion Social). In addition, the new DS49 subsidy (i.e. the main subsidy for vulnerable groups), includes different (and some additional) variables for eligibility,20 which will likely better target subsidy allocation to the most vulnerable segments.\",\"In addition, because inclusionary housing policies rely on private developers to provide affordable housing units, the requirements need to be appealing to developers and not constrain development. This often means that the thresholds for qualify ing income levels are set high and can exclude the lowest income households. Leaving housing decisions to developers creates a risk that such a policy reinforces patterns of exclusion rather than mitigating them (Cameron, 2003, Meda, 2009). For example, Denver’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance was initially designed to address urban sprawl and strenuous commuting costs for lower and middle-income workers.\",\"As elsewhere in Central Asia, the rapid population growth in cities (especially large and medium-size) since 2001 has led to a shortage of affordable housing for low-income residents, incoming migrants and even middle-class households. It shows the percentage of people replying “satisfied” to the question: “In the city or area where you live, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the availability of good, affordable housing?” Initial Assessment, Chapter 2, http:\\u002f\\u002fdx.doi.org\\u002f10.l787\\u002f9789264246768-en.\",\"This might be due to the fact that families moving to neighbourhoods that are drastically different than their original location have a lower probability of integrating successfully and remaining in that new location. Direct support generally consists of transfers from the central government to municipalities, who own the social rental housing stock.5 City governments therefore have a central role to play in realising the potential benefits of social rental housing for improving the well-being and opportunities of all residents. National legal frameworks sometimes impose a minimum target of social housing on local authorities. However, the law also allows municipalities to pay a fine rather than comply with this rule, revenues collected from these fines are redistributed to municipalities that have high proportions of social housing.\",\"Rent-to-buy schemes tend to be much smaller, at least in countries for which data has been provided. Australia and Chile both spend less than 0.003% of GDP for these programmes (Figure 9). Specifically, the spending data is missing for: Mexico and the Netherlands on financial assistance: Luxembourg and Spain on tax relief, Canada and France on rent-to-buy schemes, New Zealand on construction subsidies. Data for Austria, Denmark, Finland, Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland are not included as information on spending for two or more policy instruments is missing.\",\"The maximum eligible income is set just above the average wage in Ireland for single-income households and at 80% of the average wage in the United States and in New South Wales, Australia. Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal and England can also be considered relatively targeted systems even though the size of the social rental sector is still relatively large in France and England (sources: QuASH, Scanlon et al, 2014, http:\\u002f\\u002fwww.housingpathways.nsw.gov.au\\u002f). Shortfalls in supply of social rental housing in many countries mean that not all eligible households actually access the services and waiting lists are maintained.\",\"At the same time land-use and planning have important implications for housing policy. On the one hand they have direct effects on spatial segregation, on the other, they can limit the responsiveness of housing supply to other housing programmes by increasing the amount of time and the number of bureaucratic steps needed to obtain building permits (OECD, 2011). Furthermore, when land-use and planning restrictions limit housing supply, land and housing prices will capture the value of housing subsidies, with perverse effects on wealth distribution. Moreover, multiple levels of government are responsible for executing, regulating and sometimes delivering these policies. This high degree of complexity might lead to contrasting objectives and goals, with loss of efficiency and potentially wider negative effects on the economy. This paper identifies the main challenges faced by households in accessing good-quality affordable housing and analyses the housing policies put in place by OECD countries to understand the degree to which they share social policy objectives and pursue them through the implemented policy mix.\",\"Information on the amount of spending in Switzerland has not been included because restricted to the city of Basel. Household survey data show that social tenants account for between 1% of recipients (in Norway and Portugal), 30% in the United Kingdom and 50% in Finland (Figure 15). The proportion of recipients among home-owners is lowest in Germany (11%) and rises to over 90% in Luxembourg and Portugal. Eligibility to housing allowances in most countries is based on the household’s income, the amount of rent paid and the composition of the household.\",\"Possible research questions include: What are the most common mixes of sources of financing for social housing providers? How does the increased reliance on private debt affect the provision of social rental housing? How can providers become more efficient while providing suitable accommodation for low-income and vulnerable tenants?\",\"Accounting for 70% of the Mexican mortgage market, INFONAVIT has over time become one of the most important actors in housing development in Mexico: one in four Mexicans lives in a house financed by the institute. An additional 31.3 million workers have an account with INFONAVIT to which they are not actively contributing, likely because presently they are not formally employed. The Assembly, its highest governing body, which is comprised of representatives of the federal government trade unions and the private sector, appoints the Director General upon the recommendation of the Mexican President.\",\"While the present pension system represents a significant improvement over the previous model, the narrow range of coverage and the low level of expected pension income will leave most Mexicans with insufficient resources for retirement. Most importantly, INFONAVIT has an established relationship with formal-sector workers through the mandatory 5% employer contribution that is held in individual accounts that currently can be used to finance the purchase of a home and to supplement pension income. The proposed changes include: i) the introduction of both a universal pension for those who fail to qualify for a recognised pension and unemployment insurance (Mexico is the only country in the OECD that currently has no national system of unemployment insurance), ii) measures to increase competition among suppliers of pension sendees, and iii) additional provisions that will significantly affect the role of INFONAVIT in providing pensions and give the institute new functions in the country’s unemployment insurance regime.\",\"In particular after World War II, the housing associations played a key role in addressing the serious capacity shortages. At its peak in the early 1990s social housing in the Netherlands covered 44% of the Housing stock (Boelhouwer and Priemus, 2013). With time capacity shortages have decreased reducing the need for public sector intervention. In addition, public budget concerns and the belief that market provision could generate efficiency gains started a series of housing- policy reforms during the early 1990s (see Boelhouwers and van der Heyden, 1995). At the same time the housing associations that operate social housing have become independent organisations that - conditional on prior approval by public authorities- can take on commercial private activities so they can raise private capital complementary to public funding. These reforms enhanced the independence of social housing associations in the Netherlands: they no longer have to submit project\\u002finvestment related to social housing for approval by public authorities in advance (Algemene Rekenkamer, 2014).\",\"The poor layout and construction materials used render structures in these areas easily vulnerable to fires and floods yearly. The urban informal housing in Cebu is due to an inadequacy of affordable housing as well as high numbers of poor rural-urban migrants. These are the Local Government Code (1991) and the Urban Development and Housing Act (1992).\",\"Housing co-operatives today no longer serve lower-middle income households, but rather the upper-middle groups (Wfclawowicz, 2002). Poland could learn from a number of OECD countries that have tried to enhance the housing supply through nonprofit organisations. Whereas various measures have been introduced by governments to support non-profit organisations, policy practices indicate the importance of improving the financial arrangements with them (Box 2.13). They include for instance providing matching funds, increasing non-profit organisations’ access to capital markets and setting aside a share of national housing grants for non-profit developers (OECD, 2010a).\",\"In particular, post-Soviet transition countries have limited knowledge of informal settlements, because housing in the Soviet era was considered as a universal right, with the State providing housing and basic infrastructure free-of-charge and centrally. With the commodification of access to housing and facilities in these countries, residents have been experiencing degraded standards of living, which also now represent a great challenge for policymakers. This is why it is important to raise awareness and to develop a broad understanding of the phenomenon as well as to suggest possible solutions.\",\"While residential developments along establish roads ways are to be encouraged since they take advantage of existing infrastructure, they are problematic when the costs of servicing these areas are bom by the municipality and the externalities associated with such a location are not reflected in the costs paid by home owners. This is to be expected to some degree as lower interest rates increase an individual’s ability to purchase a property. Supply constraints also increase demand—for instance, high demand to live in a particular area because of its amenities or cultural heritage. In comparison to other departements in the region, these are low figures, Puy-de-Dome had the lowest percentage change in terms of housing prices over the period and the second lowest in terms of household income.\",\"The provided figures therefore underestimate total national public support for the sector. National level data on support for social rental housing provided by the central government is missing for Canada, Estonia, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. In addition to public subsidies in the forms just discussed, the sources of financing for social rental providers include rental income, debt finance and equity contributions. Rental income consists of the rents paid by social tenants which are, as discussed, often subsidized by housing allowances. Various rules are used in OECD countries to set rent levels in social rental housing. Rents are based on tenants’ income in Australia, Ireland, Japan, Luxemburg and New Zealand, they are set based on dwelling costs in Austria, Denmark, Finland and Switzerland, and, they are set based on the dwelling characteristics such as size and location in the Netherlands and Estonia (OECD QuASH).\",\"Banks, however, do not usually accept social housing as collateral for a mortgage (OECD 2012b). In addition, subsidised housing faces low resale values due to relatively poor construction quality and location, as well as associated restrictions on selling property purchased under a subsidy programme. This negatively impacts the wealth generation objective of Chile’s housing policy, and also affects residential mobility.\",\"The highest owner-occupancy rates are found in Easter European countries, largely as a result of the massive sell-off of the state-owned housing in the 1990s. The social rental housing sector is largest in the Netherlands (31%), Denmark and Austria (22%) while it basically does not exist in Chile, Mexico and Turkey. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. Data refer to 2013 for Austria, Denmark Estonia, Finland, Latvia, New Zealand, and the United States: to 2012 for France and the Netherlands, to 2011 for Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, England, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey: to 2010 for Mexico and 2008 for Japan.\",\"Further work is needed to increase the coverage of spending data and validate its quality. Nevertheless, the data available for a minority of countries suggest that the spending mix tends to favour homeownership, which is often not consistent with tenure-neutrality goals nor with supporting households who are most in need, as they are under-represented among owner-occupants. Section 3 outlines a number of possible areas of work that can be developed to improve the availability of monitoring indicators, better understand the prevailing obstacles to access to good-quality affordable housing, and provide policy recommendations.\",\"Issues with eligibility often concerned the identified dwelling, which did not satisfy all the required standards. The total supply of good-quality rental dwellings within the permitted rent brackets might be a constrained. Further support to promote the supply of affordable rental dwellings could be considered.\",\"These individuals and families are perhaps better targeted by social policies for affordable housing, both in terms of treatment (e.g., housing these households) and prevention (e.g., financial support for housing before households lose their homes). There may be overlap between the transitionally homeless and those households living in subpar living conditions. For instance, some countries count as homeless those individuals or families living temporarily in conventional housing with other households.\",\"Secondly, land tenure arrangements and the urbanisation of agricultural or collectively-owned land (ejido) have left a complex legacy for modern-day housing and urban development. Thirdly, Mexico has managed to address, to a large extent and with remarkable speed, the country’s quantitative housing gap and transition to more permanent housing for an increasing share of the population. Such a rapid expansion of the housing stock has been seen in only a few OECD countries. Fourthly, while public policy in other OECD countries has also tended, to varying extents, to favour home ownership in recent decades, Mexico, along with Italy and Spain, is unusual in focusing its social housing policies on home ownership. Finally, Mexico is now beginning to transition out of a long period in which housing policy has been set by an implementing body (INFONAVIT), housing and urban policy is now in the hands of an explicit policy-making body, SEDATU.\",\"Flowever, the governmental social housing projects under the 2006 Housing Law targeted a set of very specific social groups, namely “state employees, officials, government staff, government officers, and workers in economic zones, industrial, productive and high tech areas” (2006 Housing Law, article 53). Projects that have impacted urban areas for instance included housing support for such categories as “meritorious people”, social housing for students, housing for workers in industrial zones, and housing for officials. In fact, the scheme meant supporting some privileged groups and leaving out large segments of the urban poor such as the unemployed, low paid workers, privately or informally employed people, thereby illustrating a segmented and unco-ordinated approach to social housing.\",\"While this growth can in part be explained by changing household characteristics, public policy has also played a role in increasing home ow nership rates. In a number of OECD countries, a public policy push for home ownership for all segments of the population, and especially among credit-constrained households, has shown its limitations in the years since the crisis that began in 2008. Leading up to the crisis, lower income households were encouraged, via the relaxation of down-payment constraints, among other incentives, to take on mortgages to purchase a home.\",\"Mandaue City is the only exception, requiring the 20% allocation to be built within the LGU. This statutory provision has not been given the due recognition and should be fully adhered to. In Catalonia, Spain, it is mandatory that residential developments keep 30% of total amount of dwellings for both social housing (20%) and price-controlled housing (10%).\",\"Capacity-building programmes for LPAs should be established. These could be in the form of training programmes and exchange of experiences with other countries. For a property to function, it sometimes requires access to facilities outside its own boundaries, e.g., roads, garages, playgrounds and water and wastewater facilities. It is not unusual for several properties in the same village or neighborhood to have similar needs. However, homeowners are reluctant to spend on repairs and maintenance because of the nonfunctioning housing management system resulting from gaps or unclear procedures in laws relevant to housing. Further, this Law does not have a provision covering ownership of common properties for buildings without a homeowners’ association.\",\"The subsidy also allows for some payment flexibility to avoid evictions in the face of temporary income loss: a tenant who is late with up to three months of payments can pay them later without losing the subsidy. If the tenant does not pay for more than three months, the subsidy is withdrawn. While a rent guarantee is provided through a savings deposit made by the tenant, the end of the subsidy does result in the termination of contract.\",\"One example is a family, upon the loss of their home, moving in with extended family or friends. This transitionally homeless but “housed” family may be counted as both homeless and overcrowded. Despite this attempt at a common standard, national data collection strategies and estimates vary significantly.\",\"Private sector tenants receive support through housing allowances in all four countries - albeit very little in Chile - but private sector tenants account for about 30% of housing allowances recipients in the Czech Republic and 45% in Norway (see Figure 15, no information is available for New Zealand). Norway also provides public guarantees for private sector tenants and New Zealand directs part of the reported developer subsidies to the private rental sector but data on the amount of spending relative to these policies is not available. Overall, the spending mix in these countries is not tenure neutral.\",\"When renting a house in the informal market, tenants can be denied access to public services such as health and education, which is particularly damaging to migrants. While a number of possible strategies to boost the rental housing market could be proposed, it will be important for Kazakhstan to begin with broad measures targeting the fiscal, regulator}' and legal framework, to ensure a more balanced treatment between rental housing and home ownership. These efforts should be prioritised in a coherent national policy for rental housing. Authorities should proceed with caution. Peppercorn and Taffin (2013) suggest that the introduction of a more robust rental policy component to housing policy should be properly sequenced: first, assessment, second, legal, third, tax, fourth, finance, and fifth, subsidies. Kazakhstan needs to define a rental housing policy approach.\",\"Similar instruments are used, for example, also in France and the United States (Scanlon and Kochlan, 2011). The ability of this instrument to increase supply of affordable rental housing needs to be better understood and assessed against their cost. In addition to public support towards the sector, the protection of tenancy and the rules for rent setting are crucial for enabling the delivery of affordable housing through the private rental sector. Among the 20 reporting countries that provided information, 14 report applying rent controls - mostly regulating rent increases.\",\"The living space available to the household is a key dimension to be considered when assessing housing quality (CECODHAS, 2011). Evidence shows that living in an overcrowded dwelling can affect the physical and mental health of household members as well as children’s social and emotional development (UK ODPM, 2004). Moreover, living in an overcrowded space corresponds with a higher likelihood of child maltreatment and accidents in the home (UK ODPM, 2004).\",\"This policy instrument presents a number of advantages for delivering housing support to low-income households but also has weaknesses compared to social rental housing- especially in providing support to vulnerable households. There seems to be therefore room for policy improvement, as privileging support to owner-occupied housing is generally not consistent with tenure-neutrality goals nor with supporting households who are most in need. As shown so far, many households - and especially low-income and vulnerable households -struggle with their housing costs and are often faced with poor housing conditions.\",\"Central government spending for this form of support amounts to between 0.6 and 1.8% of GDP in reporting countries. Eligibility conditions and payment rates vary, but these allowances are mostly reserved for lower income and vulnerable households. In all reporting countries housing allowances are granted to private market tenants but they are often also granted to social housing tenants and owner-occupants.\",\"Consequently, young people often live with their parents until they can afford to buy a home. Unsurprisingly in a homeowner society, renting is also less popular than owning a place. This creates a burden for firms that consequently have greater difficulties to attract the talent they need or in turn need to prop up pay.\",\"However they are beyond the scope of this paper and, as explained in Box 1, they have not been surveyed in the OECD QuASH (2014). This complexity makes the classification of policy programmes difficult, nevertheless a classification is necessary to collect and monitor information. One useful and common classification divides subsidies into supply-side and demand-side. Supply-side subsidies are directed at producers of housing and can consist of direct government grants or subsidies, as well as land and tax concessions for provision of housing or urban renewal.\",\"This will be crucial in improving the quality of life and economic dynamism of urban areas for all of Chile’s residents. This could further promote mixed-income housing areas, and discourage better-off families from demanding housing subsidies. While centrally located land can be more expensive in the short term, the pre-existence of infrastructure saves money, and better accessibility reduces commuting time and its associated costs, including pollution.\",\"Do rent controls and other aspects of tenancy law strike a balance between landlords’ and tenants’ interests? National and local policies to decrease the level of spatial segregation have been developed in many countries. The effectiveness and the unintended consequences of these programmes, as well as their integration with social elements, are important for social policy makers and should be further explored. More data and knowledge are needed to estimate the affordable housing deficit and enable better policy planning.\",\"Grants to support access to homeownership consisted of one-off transfers to households for the purchase of a house whereas financial assistance to home-buyers consisted of subsidized mortgages, down-payment assistance or mortgage guarantees provided by the government. Grants were relatively important policy instruments in Chile and Luxemburg, which spend roughly 0.3% of GDP on these gi ants. Financial assistance is especially prominent in Norway (0.2% of GDP), in Australia (at least 0.7% of GDP) and in the United Kingdom (0.6% of GDP).\",\"Tax relief for access to homeownership also accounted of a significant share of homeownership support in a number of countries, especially where it was designed as non-means-tested mortgage tax relief - a regressive and distorting measure. This measure alone costed 0.36% of GDP on average in OECD countries, 0.5% of GDP in the United States and a staggering 2.3% of GDP in the Netherlands - well above the amount spent by the country on targeted housing allowances and social housing put together. As a consequence, the reported numbers are a lower-bound estimate and errors are likely to be larger in countries who do not report spending on tax relief for mortgages (see note to Figure 9). In 2009, the government estimated about 400 000 dwellings were sub-standard either because of poor construction material, lack of basic facilities or high overcrowding (OECD, 2012).\",\"Since it does not receive general budget funding, INFONAVIT does not require periodic appropriations from federal ministries or Congress. While subject to some oversight by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit INFONAVIT has considerable flexibility in setting its own priorities. For the first 30 years of its existence, virtually the only source of funding for these operations was the funds in housing accounts. Thus, historically it has had no obligation to pay competitive returns on housing accounts to obtain its funds or to maintain the confidence of those supplying funds, for, unlike depositors in a mortgage banks, the holders of housing accounts have no right to withdraw their funds.\",\"The data provided and the information available in the OECD Benefit and Wages (www.oecd.org\\u002fels\\u002fsocial\\u002fworkincentives~) show that the country provides some form of support for homeownership and rental assistance. Source: OECD Questionnaire on Affordable and Social Housing 2014, see Box 3 for QuASH details and coverage. Due to data limitations, the monetary value of support provided through rent controls and tax relief for residential housing is not quantified in OECD QuASH and is therefore not included in the spending figures. It is important to stress that this is a first attempt at producing comparable data on the instruments and amount of support towards affordable and social housing in OECD countries. In particular, not all reporting countries provided information on all surveyed instruments and information on spending, recipiency and eligibility is often missing. As a consequence, the number of reporting countries changes across policy types.\",\"In the broad-base system, social housing is open to all citizens without necessarily applying any priority criterion in the allocation of dwellings. In targeted systems, social housing operates apart from the private rental market, and only households for which the market is deemed unable to deliver housing will benefit from it. Income thresholds or vulnerable groups could be criteria for eligibility in this system. Table 2.4 shows a comparison of types of social housing systems across OECD countries that may lead Kazakhstan’s leadership in its debate to define the best system for the country.\",\"Secondly, Mexican authorities could also consider strategies for streamlining the institutional landscape of the housing sector. The paradox of the Mexican institutional structure is the existence of a large number of housing organisms, which serve specific geographies (urban vs. rural) or segments of the population but which, taken together, still do not adequately reach the entire population. Some institutional mergers could be considered over the longer term.\",\"Housing and urban policy is considered a priority within this reform agenda. The authorities seek to reduce the housing deficit that affects roughly 31% of Mexican households and to correct the inefficient development patterns of recent decades. This new approach to housing and urban policy differs from those of the recent past by shifting from quantitative objectives for housing to a more qualitative focus on housing and the urban environment.\",\"Municipalities, especially those with a large share of low-income households and a high share of unemployment, may not have the financial and organisational capacity to supply and maintain social housing. In Poland, for example, municipalities are responsible for the supply and maintenance of social housing, but due to their scarce financial resources, the supply of affordable housing has remained a major challenge, especially in mid-sized cities (OECD, 2011b). This takes the form of demand-side subsidies (e.g. tax relief on paid rent for tenants) or supply-side subsidies (e.g. favourable treatment of rental income for landlords).\",\"Because an agreed composite indicator of access to affordable good-quality housing is not available, the section looks at access, affordability and quality separately. Section 2.1 looks at access discussing the financial and legal arrangements under which households occupy their home - known as housing tenure - and how they relate to the socio-economic characteristics of the occupants, this section also discusses homelessness, i.e. lack of regular access to housing. Section 2.2 measures housing affordability and section 2.3 housing quality, relating them to housing tenure and other socio-economic characteristics of the occupants.\",\"D.S.49 also gives greater importance to social services provided to households to help them become familiar with the tasks and responsibilities related to owning a house. These entities were first introduced with the shift to demand-side support around the year 2002, the EGIS prepared the construction projects, found the land, organized eligible families and submitted the funding application to the ministry. Over time, they acquired considerable market power, there were also reports of families not being attended, incomplete projects and misappropriation of the equity contribution of the eligible families. The 2011 reforms changed radically the application process to address some of these issues, basically splitting the households’ application from the application of development projects and allowing household to apply without a project.\",\"To save on initial construction costs, developers build new housing where land is cheaper (often the periphery of cities), rather than where there is demand. There are no special requirements in terms of location directly impacting the costs and comfort of living. The owners of social housing continue to bear considerable costs related to the poor quality of construction and unsafe and inadequate location.\",\"Mobility is important to maintain support to the labour market. Kazakhstan, like most OECD countries, may wish to focus on regulating contractual aspects of tenant-landlord relations. The main motivation for restricting freedom of contract is that bargaining between landlord and tenants is often unequal, either the risk that landlords exploit their market power or that tenants hold up landlords’ property (if no sanctions for unpaid rents are provided for, for example). Box 2.10 provides a summary of the rental market regulation in across OECD countries, w'hich cover two key areas of rental markets: rent control and tenant-landlord relations.\",\"There is also evidence that the housing supply is adequate for commercial premises and vast, expensive housing units, while there is a shortage of affordable, smaller flats. The correlation is not as good when including smaller cities of district significance. Housing prices for existing dwellings declined after the 2007 housing boom, which was fuelled by the introduction of mortgages and led to a banking crisis (OECD, 2016e).\",\"The OECD average of combined outright and mortgaged owner-occupants is 65% of households. Chile, Mexico and Eastern European OECD countries have the highest rates of homeownership. In most countries, homeowners are disproportionately middle- and high-income households, whereas renters tend to have lower incomes. Middle class households are not immune to high housing costs. Indeed, nearly nine percent of mortgaged middle-class homeowners are overburdened by housing costs, on average, across the OECD. Overcrowding rates are generally higher among poor households and renters.\",\"May include people in institutions. Indicators of housing affordability usually focus on the ratio between housing costs and household income (AHURI, 2005). One useful and common measure of housing affordability is the housing cost overburden, which measures the proportion of households who spend more than a given share of household income on housing costs. Figure 3 illustrates the proportion of households who spend more than 40% of their income on housing costs, based on household survey data.\",\"Previous housing programmes to encourage residential mobility, like the 1995 Programa de Mouilidad Habitaciona!,23 had a limited effect (Simian, 2010). This was partly due to the limited choices for affordable housing in a better location. Subsidised housing has been confined to a few municipalities and neighbourhoods in the urban peripheries. This results in an “immobilising effect” of social housing on residents, stranding tenants in marginalised communities with few possibilities of social or economic progress (Rodriguez and Sugranyes, 2005).\",\"Common implementation issues are also discussed. Section 3.7 presents a first attempt at assessing the housing policy mix in OECD countries, highlighting that more work is needed to validate the comparability of data. However it is important to determine to which extent these objectives are in fact shared by housing policies, given the fact that countries intervene in housing market also for reasons not linked to social policy (see Section 1).\",\"Is the housing allowance shifted to rental prices?” Social Housing in Europe, Wiley Blackwell, pp 105-20. All European countries' estimates are derived from SILC 2012, with the exceptions of Belgium (2011) and Ireland (2010). All European countries' estimates are derived from SILC 2012, with the exceptions of Belgium (2011) and Ireland (2010).\",\"This provision has been severely criticised by social housing advocates for allowing well-off areas to escape their obligations, and many prosperous municipalities (such as Neuilly-sur-Seine) have taken advantage of it so far to resist the government’s efforts to make them increase their stock of social housing (Scanlon and Whitehead, 2011). In practice, social rental housing often concentrates low-income households in deprived urban neighbourhoods that offer low-quality public services and little access to job opportunities, which exacerbates urban social exclusion. In Chile, for example, areas identified for social housing construction were not always equipped with proper urban infrastructure, facilities or services and connectivity between social housing and job centres is often deficient (OECD, 2013e).\",\"In addition to the suboptimal location of much new housing development, migration, insecurity and the global crisis have also been important contributors to this high vacancy rate. Approximately 4.9 million homes are uninhabited in Mexico, equivalent to one-seventh of the total housing stock. Three million of these are located in cities, although there is considerable variation in the location of vacant housing within metropolitan areas.\",\"Provision of affordable private rental housing can be supported through additional instruments such as supply-side grants, rental guarantees, tax relief to tenants for rental costs and tax relief to landlords for rental income. However, little data are available on the design of these instruments and on the level of public support provided. It will be important for governments to understand how access to good-quality affordable housing can be supported through this sector. Data are not yet robust enough to provide a comprehensive cross-country analysis of the distribution of public spending across various housing policy categories.\",\"This could disincentivise investors from land banking and open up more available land for affordable housing for the urban poor. This and other fiscal measures - for example, providing incentives for development of infill sites - could also augment the overall supply of affordable housing. Previously, builders could exchange money or land instead of setting aside up to 20% of new developments for social or affordable use, a provision under Part V of the Planning Act and therefore, some developers have been able to build the social portions of new developments elsewhere. However, now social units must be predominantly on site, making it mandatory for developers to set aside up to 10% of new developments for social use.\",\"In addition, the economic crisis of the past few years is bound to increase the number of households who qualify for social rental housing (as well as for other forms of support). Only few countries show an increase in the stock of social rental housing over between 2001 and 2011, including Estonia that did multiply its stock by almost 5 times but starting from a limited stock of around 1,600 dwellings. Countries like Denmark and France have actually responded to the crisis by investing in social housing.\",\"Data not available in OECD QuASH 2014 for Chile, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, Switzerland. Both owning and renting a home have strengths and weaknesses. Homeownership can promote wealth accumulation: a home can serve as an asset, and repayment of mortgage debt can incentivize better household spending behaviour.\",\"The papers are generally available only in their original language - English or French -with a summary in the other. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. The paper also greatly benefited from comments by participants to the European Commission Seminar on Housing for the Social Situation Monitor (December 2014) and the CECODHAS Housing Europe Social Affairs Committee meeting of November 2014. The authors would also like to thank the experts who provided information through the OECD Questionnaire on Affordable and Social Housing.\",\"Reporting countries spend between 0.6 and 1.8% of GDP on housing allowances. Almost all of the reporting OECD countries use this policy instrument, in half of them, allowances are reserved for tenants - and are usually available for private and social tenants - but in the other half of the countries allowances are also granted to households who own their home. Housing allowances are usually means-tested, but eligibility conditions and the payment rate vary considerably across countries.\",\"Federal policies - federal housing finance in particular -have facilitated the development of higher quality houses, yet have often failed to contribute to the development of better cities. Reforms to INFONAVIT’s practices thus form the basis upon which a more competitive, sustainable housing and urban development model can be built. First, like many Latin American countries, Mexico has a long history of informal or irregular housing development, and a large share of the housing stock continues to be self-built, lacking legal titles or constructed outside the formal development process. Nearly one-quarter of urban households live in informal settlements.\",\"Validity of this variable for SILC, then, depends on how accurately people report their separate principal and interest payments.) In Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the United States, respondents are asked for their current or usual mortgage payment. These payments can be - but are not necessarily - inclusive of principal and interest.\",\"The SMART Housing Policy offers an incentive-based approach to encourage developers to build affordable housing that also meets elevated construction standards, and is located near transit. It provides for fee waivers as well as faster review and inspection times for developers building qualifying housing projects. It can also provide additional density, or floor\\u002farea ratio, to encourage provision of affordable housing and other community benefits, such as parking, open space and streetscapes.\",\"It has been widely documented that people living in adequate homes have better health and higher chances to improve their human capital and seize the opportunities that urbanization offers. A housing sector that performs well acts as a \\\"development multiplier\\\"' benefiting complementary industries, contributing to economic development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction.\\\" Conversely, lack of adequate housing contributes significantly to marginalization of populations and different forms of exclusion in cities.\",\"Housing can be unaffordable for middle-income households as well. Even households in the third quintile of the income distribution, face a fairly high risk of housing cost overburden. On average in OECD countries 9% of tenant households in the third income quintile are overburdened by housing costs. In some countries, overburden rates are high for third-quintile mortgage payers too: overburden rates for this group are above 20% in Sweden, Ireland and Greece.\",\"In the United States, for example, developers are offered a number of incentives to build mixed-income housing, including low-interest financing tools, density bonuses, tax abatement programmes, rehabilitation assistance, fast-tracking of plan reviews and permits, and reduced or waived fees. Emerging and middle-income families living in these units receive an extra subsidy bonus. One of the first projects to be developed through this programme, San Alberto Casas Viejas, has been set in the outskirts of Puente Alto, a municipality with among the highest concentrations of social housing in the Santiago Metropolitan Region.\",\"As result, the vast majority of the urban housing stock is now in private hands: in 2014, only 3.2% of the housing stock was in public ownership.22 Moreover, while the public housing stock has been fairly stable since 2004, the private sector accounted for almost all the growth in the urban housing stock between 2004 and 2014 (an increase of 38%). The public housing stock accounts for less than 4% of the overall housing stock in almost all large cities, including Astana and Almaty City, except in Rudnij and Pavlodar. According to Kazakhstan’s law on individual housing construction and the Land Code,23 every citizen has the right to receive a land plot for individual construction purposes.\",\"Prior to granting the building license, the municipality must set up a general plan (designating residential, commercial and industrial areas) and a detailed plan (defining the type of building). These public institutions were expected to make up for any construction shortfalls by private competitors and eventually were aimed at competing on the open market. The specific tenure of municipally owned housing was intended to play an important role in achieving the goals of housing policy after the war, namely to raise the average housing standard, to equalise the distribution of housing consumption, to restrict wealth transfers to private property owners and to counter housing segregation. While in the 1970s and 1980s, public construction was responsible for more than 75% of new rental dwellings, its importance has declined somewhat but still remains at around one half. The rent level they aim to set is used to cover direct costs, but they are not managed on a strict non-profit-making objective as they provide a return for the capital invested by the municipalities (the share of the initial municipal equity capital, though, has declined significantly over time since many MHCs were created in the 1960s and have grown since then).\",\"Micro-data, on the other hand, tend to indicate that owning a home makes people more likely to be employed than when renting, thereby pointing at a positive effect at the individual level. Recent research highlights the role of negative externalities in explaining these contradicting findings (Isebaert et al., Given the severe contraction in the housing market, the potential magnitude of this problem is significant.\",\"The architects and families developed a unit configuration that provided residents with the most essential 'half' of the housing unit, the remaining components were incrementally expanded and customized by the residents. After only one year, property values increased dramatically and residents reported the desire to stay and continue to improve their homes and strengthen their community. The mixed-income residential development incorporates urban agriculture into affordable housing practices. Via Verde brings together residents of varying income levels to engage in civic management in on-site community service programmes.\",\"Section 3 reviews these policies. Housing policy in OECD countries comprises a wide and complex mix of programmes. Direct provision still exists in many countries but support is decreasing and shifting to other types of providers. Changes in the sources of financing of social rental housing providers, coupled with changes in the socio-economic profile of their tenants, pose new challenges to social housing providers and policy makers.\",\"In 2015, the Housing Law was given a substantial revision in order to address a number of the below-highlighted challenges in the Vietnamese housing sector. Topics that are given particular attention are provision of affordable housing for low income groups, provision for recognition of self-built housing, and the inclusion of the private sector in the production of housing stock. Taken together, these measures are designed to ensure the right to use land and own property, and to regulate the transfer and sale of these rights, while also providing mechanisms to ensure that the housing and real estate markets are fair and accessible.\",\"By 2010, 93% of homes were built with durable walls and 85% with durable roofs, up from 78% and 64%, respectively, in 1990. In this respect, Mexico’s experience parallels that of Chile, which managed over several decades to reduce dramatically the quantitative housing shortage and to address significant quality gaps. The activities of these two institutions, funded through a compulsory 5% payroll tax, include both housing finance and complementary retirement income (see Box 0.1 which provides a special policy focus on pensions). The rapid expansion of housing finance, led by INFONAVIT and facilitated by public policies aiming to expand access to formal housing, enabled the country’s transition from informal to formal housing on a grand scale.\",\"The government of New South Wales in Australia introduced fixed-term tenancies in 2006, the minimum duration varies between 2 and 10 years, depending on the applicant’s circumstances. Meanwhile the United Kingdom has reduced housing benefits for households who occupy homes that are large compared to the number of occupants (the so called “bedroom tax”), which might also lead some social tenants to leave the sector. The de facto targeting of social rental housing - by which low-income households are already the majority of social tenants even in countries where eligibility is not or only loosely targeted - might mean that there is limited scope for encouraging better-off tenants to move to other forms of tenure.\",\"Lack of access to housing and housing instability are often associated with social exclusion, risks to the health, poor educational outcomes as well as with poor access to mainstream health, social work and housing services (OECD, 2014a). The quality of housing and its surroundings are also linked to health, education and child-development outcomes and to general well-being (Newman and Holupka, 2014). Good-quality affordable housing can help the elderly remain healthy and independent, facilitating the delivery of services needed.\",\"Those who would like to increase their future retirement income can either leave the funds in their accounts with INFONAVIT or obtain better returns elsewhere. Each of these functions would be carried out by a separate corporate entity, although there would be some linkages between the two. As a provider of housing finance, the two most promising ways in which INFONAVIT can remain active as a supplier of low-income housing finance in the face of reduced access to low-cost funds would be to focus on lowering targets for prudential ratios and to increase the use of alternative finance techniques (e.g. through the capital and private markets, etc.). As an asset management institution, the changes in the law that are now under consideration would oblige INFONAVIT to reconsider its role in the entire Mexican social safety net and the financial system.\",\"The result is a concentration of social housing in the peripheries of select municipalities - areas that are normally far from job and service centres, have poor transport provision and infrastructure and face a high incidence of social problems (i.e. poverty, unemployment and criminality). Since 1978, housing policy has been structured around two main pillars: i) demand subsidies targeted to households with saving capacity and access to credit, ii) the construction or assignment by MINVU of housing to low-income population with a reduced savings capacity. Public support for housing is comprised of demand-side targeted subsidies: the government provides a voucher to buy or build a house to first-time home buyers who comply with basic eligibility criteria. In addition to reducing a housing stock deficit, the policy has also aimed to improve the material and financial capacity of the population by facilitating access to a capital asset. Table 2.5 summarises the three leading subsidy programmes according to the targeted beneficiary group. Recipients sign a rental contract with a real estate company under the obligation to buy the home at the end of the contract.\",\"In the Netherlands and Denmark, where EU-SILC finds it difficult to meaningfully distinguish between market-rate and social rental accommodations, all renters are placed in the market rate category. Additionally, the Australian, Canadian, and American surveys used here do not ask whether rent is subsidized. All respondents paying any level of rent in these countries are included in their survey's “market plus subsidized” rental category. In Sweden, although subsidized housing is a survey response option, very few respondents select this option.\",\"Middle-class households are not immune: on average nearly 9% of mortgaged middle-class homeowners are overburdened by their monthly mortgage payment across OECD countries. Significant numbers of people are homeless: while statistics are difficult to compare, most OECD countries report that 1 to 8 people in every thousand lack regular access to housing. In addition, many households live in low-quality dwellings: 15% of low-income households live in overcrowded dwellings and 14% do not have access to an indoor flushing toilet.\",\"The Federal Mortgage Society (Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal, SHF) provides bridge loans with a preferential rate for developers to construct houses using eco-technology. This project is expected to help cut over 1 million tonnes of GHG emissions over 40 years, the estimated lifecycle of these houses. The air quality plan seeks to minimise emissions, while transport planning seeks to increase mobility. Transport activities are not funded or approved unless they conform to the purpose of the air quality plan.\",\"In addition, 22 reporting countries support the provision of social rental housing, either through the direct provision of housing or through subsidies to providers. Around one third of the reporting countries also use construction subsidies to promote the production of rental housing. Rent controls are used in over half of the reporting countries, but other forms of support for private rental housing, such as provision of guarantees and rent tax relief for tenants, are currently used by just over one fifth of the reporting countries.\",\"Since the programme began in 2000, 2 659 single-family units and 4 904 multi-family units have been created. In exchange for affordable units, the city offers a range of incentives. For example, the dty sold land to its development partners for USD 1 to build the first phase of Hunter’s Point South, a USD 350 million mixed-use complex designed to include 20 000 square feet (1858 m2) of retail space, a school and 900 rental units, 75% of which will be affordable to low- to middle-income families.\",\"Source: Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). Part of the change reflects a household’s preference for homeownership relative to other tenures which, in turn, is influenced by policies that influence households’ tenure choice (e.g. housing taxation, rental regulations). Another part of this change reflects purely demographic and socio-economic developments. For instance, the probability of homeownership tends to increase with age, thus it is likely that the aggregate homeownership rate would have increased in OECD countries - even if nothing else changed - due to population ageing.\",\"Through these instruments rents are set below-market levels and the duration of contract is longer than what mandated by law for private rental contracts, in exchange for rental income tax relief. Social Rental Agencies (SRAs) also take on this role in some countries, SRAs are non-profit organizations that act as intermediaries between private landlords and vulnerable tenants providing guarantees to the landlords (typically rent payments, management and administrative tasks, and physical quality of the dwelling) and support services to tenants. Evidence shows that landlords capture a sizeable share of public housing allowances by raising rents in Finland (Kangasharuju 2010, Viren 2011), France (Fack 2005, LaFerrere and Le Blanc 2004), the United Kingdom (Gibbons and Manning 2006), and the United States (Susin 2002).\",\"The transition to a market economy and large-scale privatisation resulted in the fact that virtually all public housing became private within a short period, at very low prices. According to UNECE (2016), the privatisation process was not supported by clear and forward-looking policies, legislative measures and regulator}' methods in the sphere of housing management and maintenance. Despite the growing housing stock, in 2015, the number of citizens applying for public housing programmes increased.\",\"See PUEC-UNAM (2013). This means that, on average, residents in this neighbourhood have transport expenses of MXN 1 500 per month, which represents 80% of the average monthly payments for houses acquired in the neighbourhood.

As in other post-Soviet countries, road traffic has grown rapidly in Kazakhstan since 2000. The rapid shift of goods shipment from the railway to the road network and the high level of road shipments per capita led to a rapid deterioration of roads, raising the demand for funding for repairs and maintenance (Coulibaly et al.,\",\"A mixture of legal and illegal housing appeared on these new city territories within a few years (1998-2005). In 2012, the city limits were expanded even further. The total area of new municipal territories was equal to 11.900 hectares. In 2014, the city limits were again expanded by 23 200 hectares, which included 27 settlements and a population of more than 92 000 people (President of Kazakhstan, 2014). These include such goals as to improve urban and industrial infrastructure, expand entry routes to the city', and develop mountain recreation and sport facilities for the Asian Olympic Games in the National Ile-Alatau Natural Park. The local environmental NGOs raised awareness about the construction of the new sport complex in the territory of the national park (NGO Green Salvation, 2014).\",\"This does not mean that Kazakhstan should move to a position-based system, since both systems have strengths and weaknesses, but authorities must be aw'are that the challenge is to establish a civil service responsive to the needs and specialised skill demands of contemporary Kazakhstan (and the skills required for urban development). The new law attempts to minimise the transfer of officials when new political appointments occur, these transfers will only be permitted within the same government body, and transfers between government bodies will be conducted on a competitive basis only. The Civil Service Law guarantees the continuation of employment of administrative civil servants if a government body is reorganised or liquidated and protects them from unjustified dismissal resulting from a change in government.\",\"An exhaustive list of issues to be managed by local self-governments in rural communities, municipal and urban territories is given in the Federal Law “On the general principles of local self-management in the Russian Federation”. At the federal level, the main directions for regional policy are given by the President. Sector-specific regional programmes and policies are developed and financed by sectoral ministries, and the annual budget for regional policy measures is approved by the Federal Assembly. Until September 2014, the Ministry of Regional Development was responsible for the implementation of policy measures, monitoring the effective use of budgetary funds, and inter-regional co-operation.\",\"Central government has direct influence over oblasts and cities of republican significance. They have limited scope to regulate urban issues affecting their jurisdictions. Local administrative decisions on issues such as land use planning and management, environmental protection, local economic development and zoning normally need to be approved by upper levels of government, which are not always fully aware of the needs of the cities, settlements and villages.\",\"To support the implementation of high-level documents, the ministry is responsible for the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the “National Strategy 2020”, developed in support of the “Kazakhstan Vision 2030” and “Vision 2050”. The ministry serves as the government’s technical advisor on the strategy’s design, roll-out and performance assessment, and engages with government oiganisations to co-ordinate the implementation of strategic plans.

For instance, according to local authorities, the expansion of city borders in Kyzylorda was indispensable in distributing individual land plots for construction purposes. In both Almaty City and Shymkent, according to local authorities, such expansion was necessary to improve transport infrastructure (suburban road network, new' railway tracks, car parks and bus stations), build new social objects (schools, hospitals) and develop new housing projects (in Shymkent only). Shymkent has now' the largest territory among Kazakh cities (1 170 km2).\",\"Subnational surcharges could be the most appropriate means of providing Kazakhstan’s SNGs with their own marginal revenues, especially when administrative resources are scarce. This is the course of action followed by some Canadian provinces, which rely on surcharges on national taxes.

Most of the migrants work in lowintensive sectors such as construction and retail trade. Continuous production and adaptation of technical projects that are not based on the comprehensive assessment of local needs would not bring any considerable change or help to confront urban development challenges (Leigh and Blakely, 2013).\",\"Regions contribute to the budget at different levels, and it is necessary to equalise their budget income. In Kazakhstan, the disparities in regional development are the basis of the unequal revenue position of local budgets and thus determine the essential role of interbudget relations, such as subsidies and earmark transfers. Transfers to SNGs thus include funds from the equalisation of oblasts' tax revenues to reduce disparities. On the whole, general (non-earmarked) budget transfers are based on a complex system of formulas that tries to capture the difference in the cost of providing public services in each oblast, district or city.\",\"Kazakhstan could draw inspiration from the United Kingdom’s Capabilities Plan for the Civil Service, which mostly concerns how to train individuals and develop their competences (Civil Service, 2013). The Academy of Public Administration, which provides professional training for public employees from national and regional governments, has a critical role to play in training and could lead such a scheme, given its vast experience in training. If new legislation is passed, officials from the national government travel to the regions to explain the new legislation, and in some cases, organise practical workshops to train local public employees.\",\"Nonetheless, the Law has its limitations, as newly appointed heads of public administration organisations put pressure on administrative civil servants to vacate their positions “voluntarily”. Interviews for this Review indicated that both political and administrative civil servants at all levels are not so much accountable to citizens but to those who have the power to hire and fire them. This prevents the continuation of experienced staff in public employment, compromising capacity.\",\"However, using FUAs instead of administrative data suggests that, while medium-size cites are indeed larger than expected, Almaty’s size is not lower than it should be under Zipfs Law. Almaty’s FUA is indeed much larger than the population of Almaty City alone (see Table 1.3). Overall, the city size distribution of Kazakhstan’s FUAs conforms better to Zipf s Law than statutory cities, both in 1999 and in 2009.\",\"In Kazakhstan, TL2 regions correspond to the regional level (including Astana and Almaty City), while TL3 regions are districts (rayons) and cities of regional significance. Cities of regional significance have district-level administrative status and prerogatives, in addition to municipal-level tasks and prerogatives. The four largest cities of Kazakhstan, Almaty City, Shymkent, Astana and Karaganda, are divided into city districts that are subdivisions of the municipal administration.\",\"A recent study on 32 Mexican cities (World Bank, 2016c) measured the ease of Doing Business based on four criteria: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property and enforcing contracts,51 showed substantial differences across cities, with at least one of them performing better than high-income OECD members. The conclusion for Kazakhstan is that an assessment of subnational differences in the business climate would provide a clearer understanding of the differences across regions and cities to incentivise business and investment, and place government in a better position to design and implement policy. The fifth wave of the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), provides insight into the variations of the perception of firms on the business environment across the country. For instance, insufficient education in the workforce is more often reported as the main obstacle to doing business in medium-size cities than in Almaty City or Astana (Table 1.8 above).\",\"Kazakhstan and its cities are modernising, but its urban centres still have issues to address before they can achieve their full potential as the engines of economic growth. Kazakhstan inherited a legacy of low car ownership and extensive, but not always cost-efficient, urban public transport from the Soviet era. However, car ownership has risen rapidly since the 2000s, with the highest motorisation rate in Almaty and Astana (428 and 385 cars per 1 000 inhabitants, respectively, in 2015). Car ownership has been increased by the high demand for private automobiles, moderate gasoline prices, road extensions and improvements in and around big cities, and the low quality of public transport services.\",\"The oblast-level governments, on the other hand, generate their revenue from stable taxes connected directly to their territory (taxes on real estate, transport taxes, property taxes, personal income tax and so on). Almaty City has a budget of KZT 361.9 billion for 2016 (just over USD 900 million) of which almost KZT 239 billion comes from the city’s own revenues (taxes, individual revenues, social tax and the sale of land assets). Table 3.5 also shows that cities have different levels of dependence on central government transfers. For 2016, 66% of Almaty City’s income comes from taxes, and 30% from transfers.\",\"Canada’s experience suggests that the introduction of tax relief programmes such as phase-ins, deferrals for seniors, and capping of tax increases for some classes of property, to cushion the impact of reforms are preconditions for a successful reform (Bird and Slack, 2002). Kazakhstan could even introduce a centralised assessment system to make the system less vulnerable to changes at the local level. One critical condition for a property tax reform in Kazakhstan would be to increase the capacity to administer the tax at the local level, as many cities may lack experience with property taxation. Information to support the fiscal cadastre on a consistent, nation-wide basis needs to be unified and shared across and among levels of government and the public. Political support from central government would be a key element underpinning any property tax reform.\",\"Urban development is regarded as part - and not as a complement - of the regional policy of the country. Before 2016, there were plans for the development of the urban agglomerations, but they stalled because of the financial difficulties the country is now facing. Only the action plans for Shymkent and Aktobe, and interregional action plans for Astana and Almaty City are in place.\",\"To complement Zhumasultanov’s estimates for the recent period, Table 1.4 provides a corrected urbanisation rate that neutralises the effect of Shymkent and Almaty City’s territorial expansions in 2013 and 2014. The main conclusion is that without this large reclassification of rural inhabitants to urban status, the urbanisation rate w'ould have grown at a much slower pace, reaching an estimated 55.6% at the beginning of 2016 (w'hile the official urbanisation rate was 57%). In 2015 and 2016, the new urban residents in Shymkent and Almaty City were subtracted from urban population.\",\"Pay levels make it difficult to attract and retain skilled and highly qualified staff, as civil servants (i.e. urban planners) in key cities such as Almaty are paid USD 300 per month, compared to USD 600-800 in the private sector. Kazakhstan requires a clear competence management framework to ensure the skills, knowledge and behaviour that result in good performance at individual and organisational level. Competences should be linked to different elements of human resource management (HRM), in the recruitment and selection of staff, training and development, and succession or career planning. Several models are used in OECD countries, but Kazakhstan may wish to review the French model, known as Employment, Workforce and Competency Planning (Gestion previsionnelle des emplois, des effectifs et des competences or GPEEC), as it shows how recruitment methods may incorporate competences without abandoning the established principle of selection through competitive examination.\",\"The importance of cities for GDP has been growing consistently over the last five years. In 2015, Almaty City and Astana accounted for about 15% of the country’s population, and produced one-third of national GDP, due to the concentration of high added-value activities. “ Getting cities right” can provide a supportive environment for firms, entrepreneurs and institutions to innovate.\",\"The second-largest city is half Almaty’s size, the third-largest city a third of Almaty’s size, and so on down the city ranks. The 2009 curve is the real city size distribution of FUAs, while the 1999 curve reflects the deviation of 1999 city size distribution from Zipfs Law in 1999. Almaty City is given its 2009 size in the 1999 curve.\",\"The president of the republic appoints akims of oblasts and of the cities of Astana and Almaty, who are nominated by the prime minister.

There are, moreover, dedicated ministries focusing on the problems of specific territories, such as the North Caucasus and the Far East. A similar structure of responsibility is replicated at the regional level, including in Krasnoyarsk Krai, where the governor gives the main policy directions and monitors the achievement of policy objectives. The Krai government and its sectoral ministries develop state-supported mechanisms for regional development, finance and implement regional policy measures, and control the effective use of funds.\",\"Capacity building among the civil servants responsible for the land use management is a necessary complement to this process. Kazakhstan should avoid issuing restrictive zoning rules and single-use zoning, since they lead to inflexible planning regulations. Zoning should be sufficiently flexible to give private actors leeway to shape development and allow neighbourhoods to change over time. Zoning regulations and planning decisions should target nuisance levels.\",\"Kaznext Invest could also organise an annual forum for ISC staff to share experiences and good practices and provide them with dedicated business training.

The findings and recommendations that the Council provides could be used to revise the Regional Development Programme and other related programmes.\",\"A longstanding tradition of car-oriented planning, inherited from decades of Soviet urban planning, contributed to this trend. The tradition remained even after Latvia gained its independence in 1991. As a consequence, the city has experienced a rapid increase in the level of motorisation, which has been accelerating in recent years.\",\"The central government would need to keep a certain level of authority to monitor its development, to hold akimats to account for their handling of their delegated authority. The Ministry of the Civil Service that traditionally controls HRM in central and subnational levels of government would need to redefine its role and functions. Its role could be more strategic and less managerial, as seems to be the case so far, and as is typical of OECD countries such as Finland, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\",\"One key obstacle to business innovation could be relatively underdeveloped knowledge- and information-intensive services. Business services are essentially concentrated in large and medium-sized urban agglomerations. The R&D “ranking” of Kazakhstan’s cities is relatively stable: the main development since 2005 has been the rise of Astana (from 9.1% of national R&D expenditures in 2005 to 19.4% in 2015). The science city of Kurshatov (11 670 inhabitants, home of the national nuclear centre and its research institutes) is by far the smallest city with significant R&D spending and personnel.\",\"This principle, however, could be stated clearly in all strategic government documents. In pursuing equal opportunities in government, Kazakhstan might adopt the 2015 “OECD Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Public Life” to mainstream gender equality in the design, development, implementation and evaluation of relevant public policies and budget (OECD, 2016f). The Ministry of the Civil Service and its counterparts in subnational levels need to be staffed with experts.\",\"Building on this reform, Kazakhstan may consider, in the long term, the election of akimats at all levels (including those of Astana and Almaty) through the maslikhats, rather than appointment by the central government. A reform of this kind would increase the responsiveness of local governments to their citizens through democratic institutions, since members of the maslikhat are publicly elected. The aim would be to reinforce the weak local authorities and councils. This would be comparable to the Netherlands, where mayors are indirectly elected.\",\"The national government could achieve greater clarification and co-ordination in investment decisions for urban mobility by more clearly delineating responsibility for urban transport, housing and land use. One option would be for the central government to consider providing funding and infrastructure and enforcing regulations, while oblast-level governments were responsible for the planning, design, operation and control of inter-regional transport systems. Cities of oblast significance could focus on intraconnectivity, traffic control, public security and maintenance of the local road network.\",\"It must be noted that even if 90% of government employees are in SNGs, it does not mean that the country is decentralised. The fact that local authorities, like the akims, are appointed by central government, or the oblast government in the case of rayons, means that the subnational administrations are deconcentrated units of central government, rather than autonomous self-governments. Government employees at subnational levels can thus be considered central government employees.\",\"A MoU could be established with each participating agent in the network, to encourage delivery of concrete results, establish their accountability and work collectively to achieve shared objectives. The political support of the President’s Administration Office would play a key role in ensuring commitment from different actors. Kazakhstan’s central government may also consider establishing, with the political support of the prime minister, a National Urban and Regional Development Co-ordination Council.\",\"Only Almaty City has a metro line, with plans to build a tramline. Many cities depend on taxis, most of them informal (but cheaper) private cars operating as taxis, which increases traffic in some cities. Low fuel prices and parking space for cars provide further incentives for private vehicle use and limit cities’ income for public transport improvements.\",\"There are different explanations for this, including its unpopularity with citizens, the administration of the tax, and the demanding process of property valuation. The large intergovernmental transfers also allow governments not to raise property tax rates. In Kazakhstan, most rayow-level governments and even the two cities of republican significance do not have the technological capacity and the personnel to administer property tax.\",\"Astana and Almaty City are now allowed to issue bonds to cover budget deficits. To reduce the level of dependence on transfers from higher levels of government, certain taxes could be allocated to the local level. Moreover, more efficient and clearer property taxation in rural and urban areas is essential.\",\"This does not mean that the manufacturing of innovative products should be limited to Almaty City and Astana. Indeed, while OECD countries cities benefit from high-value scientific and technological innovation activity, the fruits of this work are often produced elsewhere. It is important not to neglect the innovation potential of Almaty City.\",\"The cooperation is regulated by contracts signed between the Almaty City and Astana governments and their respective regional governments. The city of Shymkent is left under the same regional oversight as South Kazakhstan oblast, dealing with the same administrative and fiscal constraints that second-tier cities face. Shymkent is the second most populous city in the country and the largest in territorial area, but has a much lower budget than Astana and Almaty (Table 2.1).\",\"For instance, the akim of Astana recently recognised that many of Astana's current inhabitants are unregistered and therefore not accounted for in official statistics. Unofficial population estimates exist for large cities such as Astana, Almaty City and Shymkent. A systemic underestimation of actual population by official statistics in large uiban centres has many potential adverse consequences. City and regional administrations need accurate population figures to plan for uiban development and local services such as schools, hospitals and public transport.\",\"In Kyrgyzstan, 150,000 to 200,000 people have migrated to Bishkek from the provinces in the past five years. Osh, the country’s second largest city, has seen a similar influx, resulting in informal substandard housing on the outskirts. The housing units often lack basic necessities such as sanitation and running water (IFC 2006).\",\"Without reliable public transport, residents will continue to use their cars. Another crucial step would be to ensure sound financial mechanisms to help to invest in modernisation and expansion of the fleet, and exploring new modes of transport. In Astana, Almaty and Shymkent, urban transport policies require an investment strategy involving different levels of government, the private sector, investment banks and private operators.\",\"The housing stock increased more than twofold in Astana and Almaty, and also expanded rapidly in regions with strong economic and demographic growth, such as Atyrau, Kyzylorda and Mangystau. The average housing area per person increased throughout Kazakhstan. However, there are spatial inequalities: the residents of Astana and Almaty City have more housing space per person than the national average, and Astana is now well above the national average (with 28.5 square metres per capita, compared to the national average of 23.8 square metres). By contrast, residents of poorer cities such as Taraz, or in cities experiencing rapid population growth, such as Zhanaojen, have on average less housing space per capita (18.9 and 16.4 square metres per capita respectively) than the national average.\",\"The size of the functional area of Almaty City is much larger than suggested by its administrative population. Almaty is also the only polycentric functional area, i.e. it consists of the two interrelated city cores of Almaty City and Kaskelen. Almaty City has the largest commuting zone among all Kazakhstan’s FUAs.\",\"The Budget Policy Department within the MNE is responsible for managing the inter-budget relationship between the national budget and the oblast budgets. It decides on the general transfers (non-earmarked) from national to regional budgets to satisfy the needs of the region. General transfers are decided through a formula that projects revenues and expenses. The level of expenditure is largely calculated on the basis of the previous year’s data, with adjustment for inflation.\",\"Almaty accounts for the lion’s share of R&D expenditures and personnel in the country and a large share of its SMEs.62 This is important because of the need to rebalance business innovation from SOEs to private businesses: Almaty City appears best positioned for this, thanks to its sheer size and unique concentration of privately owned financial institutions and firms. Moreover, the broadband penetration rate (a crucial enabler of research activities) in Almaty City is by far the highest in Kazakhstan. To encourage productive competition between Astana and Almaty City in scientific and technological innovation, excessive concentration of public support on Astana’s cluster should be avoided in future. However, the Regional Development Programme until 2020 emphasises the role of Shymkent and Aktobe as “first-level cities” and “national level economic growth centres”.\",\"Astana’s Master Plan Until 2030 is composed of different sections: housing, transport, utilities and health care, but there is no cross-cutting analysis of the main urban priorities of the city and how each sector is going to help achieve them. The city akimats do not have the authority, resources and expertise for long-term strategic urban transport planning. Their role is limited to identifying the main routes for public transport, construction of additional highways, and minor adaptations of the existing public transport network to accommodate emerging popular passenger routes.\",\"Property tax is concentrated in the largest cities, such as Almaty, Shymkent and Astana, and, as typical in emerging economies, property tax is more important in metropolitan areas than in secondary cities. Kazakhstan may also adopt a system where akimats in urban areas can charge a land tax - where land has a higher market value - and rural akimats a property tax. Alternatively, like Brazil and South Africa, Kazakhstan could explore moving to a capital value system where tax is levied on both land and improvements and away from rental systems and site-value systems (McCluskey and Franzsen, 2013).\",\"For further details, see: Smailova, A. et al. ( The remotely located single-industry based towns and villages are losing their young and adult population, as they move to seek professional education and jobs. See: Musabaev, T.T. (2013), “Master Plan for the Organisation of the Territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan”, White Paper, Valeiy, Astana.\",\"The Executive Committee could assess how the Regional Development Programme is contributing to the “Kazakhstan 2050’’ strategic directions. The participation of the Presidents Administration Office would help to communicate high-level political support. It could meet three to four times a year and be chaired by MNE.\",\"When transferring responsibilities to local governments, Kazakhstan may wish to ensure that the functions are relevant to the communities. Action by city governments is particularly valuable where policies need to be tailored to local circumstances and responsive to local constituencies. Central and oblast levels of government are best positioned to act where economies of scale are possible, where cross-jurisdictional co-ordination is necessary, and where standardised approaches are needed to avoid free-riding.\",\"All tax rates are the same in the country. Oblast budgets are to finance expenditures including general public service, defense, public order and security, education, health care, social welfare, housing and utilities, culture, sports, tourism, agriculture, water resources, forestry and environmental protection, architecture and construction, transport and communication and regulation of economic activity. Table 3.9 shows that education, health care and housing are the main spending items in Almaty City.\",\"In addition, their focus should be primarily on servicing investors and administrative burdens, and tasks related to servicing ministries should be minimised. One option would be to involve both the regional akimat and the Regional Chambers of Entrepreneurs in the governance of ISCs, to ensure that the voice of the local private sector is taken into account in ISC governance (as is the case for the Hamburg’s Business Development Corporation, see Box 1.13). Co-ordination between the national agency Kaznext Invest and oblast- level ISCs on investment promotion and facilitation is essential, and should be enhanced. This could be done by giving Kaznext Invest a reserved seat on the executive board of all ISCs in Kazakhstan or the use of shared staff and\\u002for facilities, for instance.\",\"However, Kazakova (2015) argues that maslikhats have no real power over the local state administration and perform a ceremonial role. Local executive bodies exercise only those powers and responsibilities that central government confers on them. According to the government, this number makes up 91.7% of akims at all levels who have direct contact with citizens.\",\"Oblasts and rayons have their own training centres for professional advancement. This has the potential to effectively identify gaps in employees’ current skills and help them map out training and development plans. Belgium has introduced “development circles” focused on building competencies to achieve personal and organisational goals.\",\"Finally, it concludes with proposals to cultivate dialogue with citizens and make them active contributors to the urban planning process. Its major cities are also modernising, as their institutions make the transition from a young post-Soviet country to an established independent nation. If urbanisation is to be effective, it should ensure prosperity, social cohesion and environmental protection, but how to guarantee those benefits presents a major challenge. Existing institutions, state budgets, and administrative and cultural practices are not fully ready to transform urbanisation into one of Kazakhstan’s major assets. Given the traditional concentration of skills and resources in Kazakhstan’s central government, the resources, responsibilities and capacities available to local governments are limited. The underlying issue is not whether Kazakhstan has the right local government structure, but rather how well-co-ordinated the different levels of governments are, and the equity and efficiency in the distribution of responsibilities, decision-making powers and resources for urban development that each level of government is granted.\",\"Astana’s core city experienced faster population growth than its commuting zone from 1999 to 2009. Astana’s commuting zone includes 35 rural districts (selski okruga) and 2 posiolki (rural settlements) scattered around a relatively large territory in the Tselinograd, Arshaly and even Ereymentau districts. Two municipalities (corresponding to three settlements on the map below) in the North of Karaganda region are also part of Astana’s commuting zone (see Figure 1.A2.2).\",\"This meant that urban and regional development issues were not given adequate consideration in the political agenda and in citizens’ perception. This would require increasing the authority of local authorities at the oblast, rayon and even town levels, which could coordinate investment to cities to promote growth. Kazakhstan needs to diversify the mechanisms for horizontal co-ordination (i.e. ministerial posts for cross-cutting issues, and rotations of government managers) at the central level for urban policy.\",\"Some cities, such as Almaty, Shymkent and even Astana, may focus on the compact city even in the context of growing populations. Emphasis should be given to connectivity and mobility to achieve this. Transport investments and land-use planning can give sharper focus to the inner city, providing transport options that support a mix of residential and commercial uses in medium-density inner city.\",\"There is an urban dimension to this, since broadband Internet access has developed much more quickly in Almaty City than in Astana or other regions (Figure 1.35). Dispersing scarce public funding over a number of specialised sciences or smart cities, or several innovation clusters based in special economic zones (SEZs), may detract from the success of any one city, including Almaty City. The risk is also that the complex layers of priorities and institutions ultimately exceed the capacity of the national and subnational bureaucracies.\",\"Developing policy proposals on collective ministerial responsibility could serve the public interest, so that it is possible to work across institutional lines to develop the best possible policy. To promote sustainable and inclusive urban development, Kazakhstan needs to improve the efficiency of data collection at the city level and provide reliable quantitative analysis of urban issues. This leaves SNGs with few internal financial resources and a lack of incentives to develop their own tax base. The most important taxes go to the central government’s budget and are distributed to regional governments.\",\"This may include moving staff from one ministry to another and from one area of specialisation to another. A candidate will need specific expertise, work experience in lower positions and continuous training. If no ideal candidate is found, the competition is opened to the wider civil service, and eventually to external candidates. The aim is to facilitate the promotion of public servants, since in the past, external candidates had preference.\",\"The local representative body, or maslikhat, is elected by the inhabitants of the oblasts or rayon (for a city of oblast value). It expresses the will of the citizens, determines measures to implement this will, and controls their implementation in accordance with legislation. Villages and small towns do not have maslikhats (Makhmutova, 2006, Bhuiyan, 2010).\",\"The actions of the akimat and akim are binding on the whole territory of the administrative and territorial unit. The validity of the akimat's acts and decisions can be suspended completely or partially by the president, the government of Kazakhstan, a higher-level akimat or akim, or the akimat or akim themselves, as well as by court decisions (Makhmutova, 2006). Maslikhats, or local councils, are elected for a four-year term directly by the citizens of the representative territories and approve the “comprehensive development plan” of their region or city.\",\"Astana and Almaty, and urban areas of the oil and gas industry-based oblasts of Atyrau and Mangystau, are the main destinations for internal migrants looking for jobs or better prospects. In Astana, the number of citizens increased from 289 700 to 814 400 between 1996 and 2013.22 The share of the service sector of Astana’s economy increased from 1% in 2000 to 10% in 2013. Astana receives people mostly from the comparatively close regions of Akmola, Karaganda, Kostanay and East Kazakhstan, while Almaty receives most of its immigrants from Almaty oblast, Zhambyl, Kyzylorda, Taraz, South and East Kazakhstan.\",\"In the western areas of Kazakhstan, the rapid growth of Zhanaozen, Aktau is connected to the strong dynamics of natural resource extraction (i.e. hydrocarbons). Astana’s impressive population growth during the period corresponds to the relocation of Kazakhstan’s central administrative apparatus and the headquarters of large state-ow'ned enterprises (SOEs). In contrast, the population of FUAs in the northeast of Kazakhstan stagnated or even declined during 1999-2009.\",\"Both organisations have a dual mandate, including supporting business innovation and entrepreneurship (with a focus on energy efficiency of city services and “smart city” development in Astana) and assisting investors. In Almaty City, the ISC (within the JSC “Almaty Development Centre”) is the only regional ISC with a comprehensive website dedicated to foreign investors in English (http:\\u002f\\u002finvestinalmatv.com\\u002fen). Subnational investment promotion agencies are usually small, flexible organisations w'ell-connected to both the local administration and business community. In Kazakhstan, ISCs may require additional resources (both financial and human) but also need to be incorporated into the larger set of investment promotion and facilitation activities of Kaznex Invest.\",\"Cities are major recipients of intra-regional and interregional migrations, and internal migration is a driving force in Kazakhstan’s gradual urbanisation. However, its importance should not be overestimated: in most large cities, natural population growth is higher than net inward migration (see Chapter 1). Distance plays an important role in determining internal movements in the country, but migration across cities or regions can also be explained by economic incentives, since migrants are attracted by higher wages or incomes.\",\"Population growth correlates closely with the number of square metres of new housing space, both at the regional level and in the 38 cities of regional significance (see Figure 1.19). However, some smaller towns, where population is stagnating or falling, are nevertheless seeing significant housing stock growth. In the city of Shu (Karaganda oblast), where population is stagnating, the housing stock has increased by 2.7% every year since 2011.\",\"To boost Kaznex Invest’s effectiveness in attracting investors to the key strategic sectors, the government of Kazakhstan requested a review of Kaznex Invest operations from the OECD and a benchmarking in relation to best practices in other agencies, with a view to making adjustments in its mandate, structure, or operations (OECD, 2015d). Investment Promotion Agency of Kazakhstan: how well is it doing? ( Only 5% of total FDI inflows were estimated to have been directly generated by Kaznex Invest in 2013, as compared to 11% in Nicaragua or 33% in Czech Republic. Reasons for this relatively poor performance included, the relatively large mandate of the institution, which resulted in lesser attention given to investment promotion and facilitation, its focus on serving the needs of the ministry1 rather than of investors, and a lack of clear strategy', well-identified priority sectors and key performance indicators that were outcome- rather than process-oriented and in line with the pre-identified strategy .\",\"The akims are vertically subordinated to the government, which limits their interest in solving local problems. In general, they are not interested in gaining popular support or for what purpose. The fact that akims at oblast and rayon levels can be dismissed at any time at the president’s discretion is an indication of the control over SNGs.\",\"A comprehensive migration policy and legislation could help cities prepare for and respond to emerging problems. Developing a system in Kazakhstan that makes it easier for migrants to register, and that allows for accurate data on migration flows for urban planning, should be a top priority. This could be done by using citizens’ identification numbers rather than their registration status as the basis for access to public services. Strengthening the public administration of subnational governments will be central to “getting cities right”. Intergovernmental relations are based on hierarchical subordination of lower levels of government, so that the level immediately above exercises considerable influence over local decisions. This is evident both in the appointment of akims by the upper executive power and the degree of dependence on transfers from the upper level of government.\",\"It is not possible to create an urban agglomeration exclusively at the behest of the national government, city and regional governments should have a role in the planning and management. To create new inter-regional policy space, both city and oblast ctkimats have to control territorial development and share some of the managerial responsibilities. It requires, among other things, holistic and inclusive urban policies that support economic growth.\",\"For example, housing and utility services, transport and communications, and energy saving and energy efficiency are urban-related areas for which all levels of government seem to bear some responsibility. In education, for instance, local governments are responsible for financing schools. However, given the different types of school, and the division of responsibilities between national and regional governments, the system is highly complex. One example is the “Almaty Green Growth Project”, which has suffered from ongoing debate about who is to administer it, since the oblast akimat and the city akimat both have responsibility and interests in the initiative.\",\"Redistribution of shared taxes is made through an equalisation mechanism. The current decentralisation programme is expected to increase the financial autonomy of lower-level governments by assigning new shared taxes and own-source tax revenues. Whereas in OECD countries, income tax is a principal source of revenue for the national budget (for instance, 50% of the U.S. federal budget comes from income tax), income tax in Kazakhstan only accounts for 7.3% of the total revenue of the state budget (Kysykov, 2013: 91).\",\"After 1991, the dismantling of many elements of the Soviet system (including the compulsory work placement of young graduates, heavily subsidised transport and energy tariffs) reshaped Kazakhstan's urban system, concentrating population in large cities. Along with official data based on the administrative definition of urban areas, it introduces the functional urban areas (FUAs), w'hich offer a new picture of its urban agglomerations, based on settlement patterns and travel-to-work commuting flows. This chapter then reviews the links between urbanisation and economic growth and key economic challenges related to cities (including singleindustry towms and attracting foreign investments).\",\"They focus on three objectives: i) to establish a clear, predictable and legitimate framework supported by competent and well-resourced authorities, ii) to ground the selection of PPPs in value for money, and iii) to use the budgetary process transparently to minimise fiscal risks and ensure the integrity of the procurement process. However, the lack of adequate planning for migration results in squatter settlements, slum areas, traffic congestion, urban poor and urban sprawl. Kazakhstan’s national and subnational authorities show little evidence that they have taken the necessary' steps to absorb newcomers into cities.\",\"Information on the positive outcomes of such initiatives could be disseminated more widely and opportunities for similar projects could be exploited in other municipalities. Invisa Fiduciary Services (IFS) operates the YUMP Academy pilot project together with YUMP Holding Inc. (AB), Botkyrka municipality and a large number of support companies. The project is financed by IFS, NUTEK, YUMP Holding Inc. (AB) and Botkyrka municipality.\",\"It identified 26 FUAs, accounting for 55% of the overall population. This is close to the median population share of FUAs in OECD countries (56%). The FUA analysis thus suggests that the country’s urbanisation level is not as low as indicated by the comparison of national urbanisation rates, and that Kazakhstan is not “under-urbanised” compared to OECD economies.\",\"In Soviet Kazakhstan, rich in natural resources, cities mainly served as the base for the mining of natural resources. None of the Soviet cities was planned to be economically self-sufficient. Each city or town was directly dependent on another city or town, often located in the territory of the other Soviet Republic.\",\"Indeed, other governmental institutions in Kazakhstan have similar, if not overlapping, functions as Kaznex Invest. They include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a special Government Council charged with the co-ordination of major investment projects, which appears to have a large network abroad. While the co-ordinating role of the MID on investment promotion is progressing, the Investment Policy Review' also highlights the need for increased co-operation between various institutions to increase the impact of investment promotion and reduce costs. A recent review of Kaznex Invest operations conducted by the Eurasia Competitiveness Programme (hereafter, OECD, 2015d) found that the agency’s performance was relatively poor compared to selected benchmarks (investment promotion agencies from Turkey, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Nicaragua that performed well).\",\"This reform package includes the formation of an effective state apparatus, ensuring the rule of law, facilitating industrialisation and economic growth, developing national identity and unity, and enhancing government accountability. However, Kazakhstan cannot enjoy its full economic and social development if the strategy does not acknowledge and enhance the role of urban centres. The experience of OECD countries shows that no country has become rich and developed without successful cities (OECD, 2015a). Cities are the engine of economic development, and their productivity and sustainability is at the core of their success.\",\"National policy is typically based on national averages that do not represent any particular region or city. Once the lens is adjusted to the right scale, it will become easier for Kazakhstan to understand the most pressing challenges of each region and how best to address them. While some issues may apply nation-wide, others require complementary policies that vary from place to place. This will require fine-grained data, indicators and policy approaches and require co-ordinating responses with subnational governments. The Five-Year Economic Plans serve as the basis for approval of the local budgets planned for three years, including money for implementation of the economic plans. All 14 oblasts and the two cities of republican significance (Almaty and Astana) are now responsible for the “Five-Year Forecast of Socio-Economic Development” (TlpozH03 coifuajibno-3KOHOMmecKoeo pa38umm\\u002fFSCD) and “Five-Year Programmes of Territorial Development” (JlpoepaMMa pa3eumm meppumopuu\\u002fPTD).\",\"This is a positive step towards monitoring the results of Kazakhstan’s recent efforts to improve the business environment for firms and tracking city-level differences and progress towards the implementation of reforms. According to the forthcoming 2017 Investment Policy Review of Kazakhstan (hereafter, OECD, 2017b, forthcoming), national and subnational investment promotion agencies play an important role in facilitating foreign investments, and helping the government mobilise FDI into priority sectors (on this topic, see also Harding and Javorcik, 2007). This forthcoming Review covers in detail Kazakhstan's investment policy, including investment promotion policy. In particular, it highlights the challenge due to the fragmentation of Kazakhstan’s investment promotion activities and the resulting lack of transparency.\",\"This is also the case of several mid-sized FUAs (Taraz, Uralsk, Atyrau, Aktau and Aktobe).10 In contrast, in the other two metropolitan areas of Kazakhstan (Astana and Shymkent), the city cores grew' more rapidly than the commuting zone between 1999 and 2009. In OECD countries, suburbanisation has been particularly strong in large metropolitan areas (of more than 1.5 million people). Figure 1.10 shows the contributions of commuting zones and city cores to overall FUA growth during the 1999-2009 period.

Equatorial Guinea (70.6 per cent urban), Botswana (67.2 per cent urban), South Africa (64.8 per cent urban) and Seychelles (55.4 per cent urban), have high GDP per capita. African countries are beginning to promote cities and urbanization for socio-economic development by prioritizing urban planning and development. This is expected to enhance economic diversification at the local levels, leading to employment and wealth creation, increased opportunities for knowledge and skills transfer and innovation.\",\"Whereas many secondary cities were able to economically specialize in certain products and develop a comparative advantage at the national level over time, they proved to be overly dependent on vertical specialization which characterized their economic organization. Economies of scale worked within a framework of vertical specialization, but when these industries were challenged by lower labor costs in Latin America and later in Asia, they were unable to compete. De-industrialization first hit North America and Europe and later Latin America as jobs moved to China and other African and Asian countries.\",\"In this period, the absolute number of people living in Africa’s slums increased by 14.8 million to about 212 million people (figure 3.5). The proliferation of slums in African cities is the most significant manifestation of rapid and unplanned urbanization outpacing demand for services. Living conditions in the urban slums and informal settlements are particularly dire.\",\"Conversely, when a built environment is dysfunctional for children, it affects everyone's quality of life. Looking at specific needs of children and their caretakers for every age helps to determine both generic and specific solutions for babies, toddlers, young children, adolescents and youth. The scales reflect the social ecological model that children's development specialists use to build strategies to ensure children's rights. The access to appropriate urban services needs to be adjusted accordingly to a childs age, needs and the daily patterns of its caretaker.\",\"It is at this point that we need to discuss the whole question of slums or informal settlements, particularly in the developing world. Images of slums were ubiquitous, as the favelas of Brazil and the huge, unserviced settlements of Nairobi caught the world’s imagination. But as an issue, and a challenge to urban managers, the problem was not by any means new, so we can consider it a persistent issue in the classification of this chapter.\",\"Access to public goods remains highly unequal even within urban areas, often putting the social fabric at risk. African cities are facing an unprecedented combination of developmental challenges together with rising environmental risks such as unsafe sanitation, climate change and air pollution. Are urbanisation trends sustainable in your country?\",\"Purchases may take place in areas with stagnant or declining home values or in distressed neighbourhoods (see Box 5) and their financing is more likely to be subprime, with potentially high interest rates and fees. Poor people living in areas with highly concentrated poverty experience inadequate schools, limited job prospects, and disadvantaged peer groups, all of which contribute to social exclusion. Residential segregation was encouraged (and sometimes enforced) by governments worldwide throughout much of history, in order to restrict the movement of various religious, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups (Nightingale 2012). Throughout the 20th century, government-sanctioned segregation gradually lessened across OECD countries.\",\"In addition, Africa’s urbanisation is taking place in a resource and climate-constrained world unknown to earlier urbanisation (Swilling, 2015, Currie et al., Ensuring that the ongoing wave of urbanisation is more sustainable than in the past is of strategic importance to Africa and to the world at large. It took Europe 110 years to move from 15% urban in 1800, to 40% in 1910.\",\"In recent years, urbanisation has accelerated in Rwanda, with an annual rate of 4.1 per cent, and will continue to increase with demographic growth, rural-urban migration and the reinstallation of displaced persons and refugees. Indeed, Rwanda's urban policy stands out for its positive and anticipatory approach, embracing urbanisation as a key priority area in national development strategies. Rwanda's national development strategy: Vision 2020, elaborated in 2000, seeks to stimulate economic growth in order for the country to achieve middle income status.\",\"The final section takes account of the staying power of Africa’s rural economy. The share of urban residents has increased from 14% in 1950 to 40% today. By the mid-2030s, 50% of Africans are expected to become urban dwellers (Figure 6.1).' Urbanisation is likely to continue and level off at about 56% around 2050.\",\"Already, half of all people live in urban areas. By mid-century, over two thirds of the global population will call these places home. This report focuses on the children - more than one billion and counting - who live in urban settings around the world. Cities attract and generate wealth, jobs and investment, and are therefore associated with economic development.\",\"In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, a country's population will tend to have a higher proportion of children. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, urbanization rates are high and must be coupled with better efforts in urban expansion planning and slum upgrading. Based on the concept of the demographic dividend, however, this rising urbanization phenomenon could be called the urban dividend, urbanization as a window of opportunity to improve people's well-being when planning is properly undertaken.\",\"This presents an opportunity for African cities to pursue a different development model from the more recent western development trajectory, characterized as it is by car-oriented development. Per capita GDP is in parentheses. In Africa such diseconomies may be setting in prematurely given the speed of urbanization, poor planning, weak institutions to guide urban growth and low incomes of many cities and urban residents.\",\"This implies that African countries and development partners need to invest more resources in gathering data and refining the methodologies to establish baselines and monitor progress. Data and metadata for this indicator are available, and latest data for the majority of African countries are from 2014. For Africa, the proportion of the urban population living in slums declined to about 34 per cent in 2014, from 37.5 per cent in 2010 - a 3.6 per cent. The decline in the proportion of people living in slums can be attributed to the slum redevelopment and affordable housing programmes that several countries in the developing regions, including in Africa, have rolled out in the past years.\",\"On the other, major public investments are moving forward: the financing of the Nador West Med port has been completed, a call for tenders for the Kenitra Atlantique port was issued in January 2016, and work on the TGV high-speed rail line has continued. These initiatives are bearing fruit, with the automobile sector becoming the country’s chief exporter in 2015. The developments are occurring in parallel with a search for new partners, with Morocco continuing to position itself as a platform for access to African markets.\",\"These instances show that it is possible to fulfil commitments to children - but only if all children receive due attention and investment and if the privilege of some is not allowed to obscure the disadvantages of others. Accordingly, the final chapter of this report identifies broad policy actions that should be included in any strategy to reach excluded children and foster equity in urban settings riven by disparity. Every year, the world’s urban population increases by approximately 60 million people.\",\"Such aspects include the increased flows of refugees and migrants, the region has the largest global number of IDPs, at 17.3 million. Urban slums are not a significant feature in the Arab and North Africa region as a whole, but certain countries in North Africa have very high levels of informal settlement. The complex nature of the evolving risk landscape is most articulated in coastal areas, which are particularly susceptible to flooding, as well as seismic and climate risks.\",\"They are the places where new economic ideas crystallize and where heterogeneous groupings of people learn to co-exist as neighbours. They are the places where new economic ideas crystallize, where heterogeneous groupings of people learn to co-exist as neighbours, and where democratic experiments emerge to make way for previously excluded social groups to be included as genuine decision-makers. The high density of people in cities facilitates economic growth through better sharing, matching and learning, and as Alfred Marshal famously ^ said, just the sheer concentration of people leads to new Ideas because “ideas are in the air.\\\" Not only do cities feature high densities of people, but their high densities also force people of different religions, nationalities, ethnicities and sexual orientations to live and work alongside one another, and in doing so, they get to know “the other,” leading to a cosmopolitan respect for differences. The 2008-2009 Occupy Wall Street protests across cities in the US were a collective uprising by low and middle-class groups to protest against their exclusion from the sharing of urban wealth.\",\"About 74% of the Namibian households cannot afford conventional housing and only 57% of urban households have access to sanitation facilities, which has serious environmental and health implications. The government’s ongoing public housing programme will need to be completed with better urban infrastructure development programmes and further strengthening of rural growth points to create more rural jobs. Agriculture continues to drive the economy, and as it is mostly rain-fed, it is very much at the mercy of climate-related shocks. Economic prospects are quite good, mainly because of the expected expansion of extractive industries and more investment in agriculture and transport.\",\"The balance of change seemed to be positive in terms of decreasing inequality over time. Still, the story is an open-ended one, not least because “inequality is multidimensional and cannot be viewed solely through the prism of income. Besides, how communities organize and how their communities are planned and located may overcome basic disabilities caused by income scarcity.\",\"In various countries urban data is available only for one point in time and in general inequalities remain quite high. Still, the data suggests an urgent need for African countries to address income inequality since this economic divide has the potential to hinder development and stall progress. In major economic powerhouses such as China, India and Indonesia, inequality indicators are deteriorating.\",\"For example, around 200 supermarkets and 10 hypermarkets sell the equivalent of 90,000 small shops and account for up to 30 per cent of Kenya’s food retail market (UNDP, 2012). Knowledge sharing between lead firms and suppliers will be important for upgrading Africa’s food production and its ability to compete in global markets (UNECA, 2013). Contract farming is becoming more common, but in many places small farmers face barriers to entry.\",\"A good example is the case of Medellin, Colombia, which being spread over a valley and overhanging hills is one of the most spatially divided cities in the world. Since then, five cable car lines link the poor barrios located on steep inclines to the rest of the city, providing quick, safe transit for commuting workers and vendors and providing a sense of civic belonging to one single urban space. For instance, informal settlements or slums are not just an expression of economic exclusion (the poor unable to afford formal land\\u002f housing), but can also be produced at the intersection of these various forms of exclusion (Chapter 5 “Just” Environmental Sustainabilities).\",\"Housing, through backward linkages, can encourage construction industries to form, including basic industries such as cement and steel. Strategies to expand housing and construction employment should focus on reforming regulatory barriers and supporting education and training, particularly for women and youth. Housing is 55 per cent more expensive in urban Africa than in other developing countries’ urban areas (Dasgupta, Lall and Lozano-Gracia, 2014). The typical house price to income ratio globally ranges between 3:1 and 5:1, but often in Africa, even for public service employees whose average income is higher than the majority’s, the ratio goes above 10:1, which is far above the 4:1 threshold that development practitioners suggest signals a serious problem with housing supply (Bertaud, 2015).\",\"They form isolated communities in inner-city slums or on the outskirts of growing cities, without access to services and with limited access to the formal labour market. Cities fail when they do not address equity. Without strong institutions, effective health and social networks, fair wealth distribution and a safe and clean environment for living and working, population's distrust in institutions grows, disparities increase, violence increases and new economic investments do not occur. When they succeed, cities are prosperous for all.\",\"Evidence shows that within cities, socio-economically vulnerable groups often suffer the most from poor environmental conditions. Such poor environmental conditions in cities are often associated with other forms of socio-economic exclusion. The epidemiological literature on pollution levels also shows that intra-urban variations are even larger than variations between cities. For example, in the case of Malmo, Sweden, geo-mapping analysis outlines that the socio-economic status of the neighbourhood of residence seemed to be a strong predictor of children’s level of exposure to pollution (Chaix et al., In the United States, a University of Minnesota survey based on 2000 US census data found that minorities were, on average, exposed to 38% more nitrogen pollution than Caucasians, with a significant gap when accounting for race and\\u002for income (Clark, Millet and Marshall, 2014).\",\"It is projected that four countries will experience slow urbanisation, increasing less than 2 percentage points in urbanisation levels between 2010 and 2030: Djibouti, Mauritius (which will continue to experience negative urbanisation), Swaziland and Zimbabwe. While African urbanisation patterns are diverse, up to now few may be deemed sustainable economically, socially or environmentally, as confirmed by the AEO 2016 experts’ survey (Figure 6.1S). Without productive jobs in rural areas, most economies have seen labour move from agriculture into urban, low-skilled and informal service activities.\",\"Majority of cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean allocate less than 15 per cent of land to streets in the city cores and less than 10 per cent in the suburbs. Out of 40 cities analysed from these regions, 7 cities allocated more than 20 per cent of land to street in their city core. Regionally, sub-Saharan African cities have less space allocated to open public spaces (43 per cent).\",\"In general, countries' urban populations are defined as the residents whose main source of income is not from agriculture or forestry (Satterthwaite, 2010). Urban population projections often do not include high- and low-variant estimations, which are typical of world population projections published by the United Nations (Satterthwaite, 2007, United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2012). Moreover, the traditional urban\\u002frural dichotomy has become increasingly inadequate for distinguishing between urban and rural settlements.\",\"Africa's SEZs are underperforming, however, against those in Asia and Latin America. While they have made major improvements in infrastructure, supply chain access and human capital compared with the surrounding environment, these improvements are often not at the level needed to out-compete other countries for investment (Farole, 2011). Farole’s review of SEZs in Africa has many findings, in particular that “Location and market size matter. Zones with proximate access to large consumer markets, suppliers and labor tend to be more successful” (2011, p. 4). This highlights the importance of components of agglomeration economies and spatial considerations for industrial success.\",\"Some of it is formal and some undocumented, but almost all is low-paid - for example, as factory hands, shop assistants, street vendors and domestic workers. This effect is often referred to as the 'urban advantage'. Gaps between rich and poor in towns and cities can sometimes equal or exceed those found in rural areas. Tajikistan and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), the education gap between the richest 20 per cent and the poorest 20 per cent is greater in urban than in rural areas.\",\"With a remarkable literacy rate exceeding 85%, Cabo Verde has the foundation for an economic lift-off driven by a robust urban population with skills for a competitive private sector. The country’s urban renewal can therefore be an important driver of structural transformation in the years ahead. The region is facing persistent pockets of insecurity at its northern and eastern borders because of the threat of Boko Haram and the crisis in the Central African Republic. Cameroon's growth in 2015 has been estimated at a solid 5.7%, led mainly by the secondary sector, which grew by 8.4%.\",\"A child's degree of independence will depend on his or her age, cognitive capacity and education, and may still require guidance from parents, caretakers or peers. A well-connected street network has many short links, numerous intersections and minimal dead ends. Children depend on street connectivity as it's also a proxy for walkability. The city's success is based on an inclusive approach to urban development that targetted social issues such as urban violence and poverty with public space programmes and infrastructure investments.\",\"Slum dwellers are a heterogeneous population, and not only the very poor live in slum communities (UN-Habitat, 2003). Even though slum areas can differ substantially cross-nationally in size and other characteristics, extreme housing deprivation is a common trait. The numbers are relatively less dramatic in Brazil: 3.3% of people in Brazilian faveias lack access to tap water and 12.3% lack an indoor flushing latrine in their homes (IBGE, 2010).\",\"Will technology in fact help to overcome the formal\\u002finformal and rich\\u002fpoor dualisms facing African cities—or to deepen them? African cities are well positioned to avoid the mistakes and negative externalities dampening growth and social development in cities in the Americas and Asia. The new African city can be smarter and more efficient, avoiding the costly retrofitting required in many of the world’s more recently established cities. African countries tend to have very low carbon footprints, with many countries emitting less than 1 ton per capita.18 Under the right policies, carbon emissions will not have the same relationship with economic growth as seen in the Americas and Asia.\",\"Furthermore, inequality in child well-being is not confined just to childhood outcomes - it is already manifest in access to essential services. Sanitation shows one of the largest relative disparities: in half of the countries analysed, children of households in the poorest urban quintile have basic sanitation services that are at least two times lower than children from the richest urban quintile. Coverage is four or more times lower in almost half of the countries analysed in rural areas.\",\"Some countries also report more specific objectives for some parts of the housing sector. Objectives for the social rental sector, for example, include reducing its construction and running costs (Denmark), improving its regulation (the Czech Republic), or enabling a more diverse range of providers (New Zealand). The phenomenon is significant in other OECD and key partner countries as well: around 30% of the urban population lives in slums in in India and Brazil, 23% in Indonesia and South Africa and 19% in Mexico (see UN Millennium Development Goals Database, 2014). Due to rapid urbanization in developing countries, the number of slum dwellers is projected to grow in the coming years (UN-Habitat, 2014) and eradication of urban slums by 2020 has been included by the United Nations among the targets of the UN Millennium Development Goals (Target 11 of Goal 7).\",\"As countries urbanize, they gain in wealth, and as such, work and educational opportunities for women tend to increase, leading to later marriages, and fewer children. The positive urban dynamics behind the demographic transition to smaller families is complex, and have been studied intensively,24 but as a general rule, higher rates of urbanization along with growth in GDP lead to lower fertility rates around the world. This has created a demographic momentum characterized by a relatively young population with children under age 15 accounting for 28 per cent of the population, and youth aged 15 to 24 accounting for a further 17 per cent.25 The significant increase in proportion of persons aged 15 to 24 is referred to as the youth bulge.\",\"The Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) is a more ambitious undertaking (see box 1.3 in chapter 1). The figures are computed by ECA using data from UNCTADSTAT. With the industrial revolution the urbanization process and its speed went through a dramatic shift—ultimately forming today’s megacities, transforming the world's population to a predominately urban one and now rapidly transforming Africa.\",\"In its second part, the project anticipates and prevents the creation of new slums by making new land viable and constnictible. Some of the lots are then reserved for modest families, to offer them an affordable alternative to unsafe housing. Finally, the project aims at financial equilibrium in order to be reproducible and to have as great an impact as possible on the lives of the populations concerned.\",\"However, global trends have contradicted this prediction, with populations shifting towards cities even in developed countries, and especially in Africa. The spatial nature of agglomeration economies is at play: in-person interactions are still important for networks, knowledge sharing and relationships: goods still travel by truck and rail, food cannot yet be 3D printed, and workers still commute to offices, stores and factories daily. In the light manufacturing sector small firms in Africa are constrained by access to land and finance as well as entrepreneurial skills (Dinh et al., Helping to remove these barriers could open up opportunities for aspiring informal sector operators.\",\"It is organized as a framework of drivers, enablers (at the levels of the national system of cities and within cities), barriers and policy levers (figure 4.1 and box 4.1). Cities themselves can be enablers of industrial productivity due to agglomeration economies. As Africa urbanizes, the purchasing power of the middle class is growing.3 The power of Africa’s growing consumer class can be leveraged to stimulate industrial development to meet rising demand domestically and regionally as a stepping stone to broader global integration. While this relationship is not independent of per capita GDP growth, some categories of consumption are associated with urbanization, independent of total income.\",\"They simply do not appear on the map. Slum dweller populations will continue to grow and many countries are not prepared to address the challenge with affordable housing, basic services and security of land tenure.\\\" Sub-Sahara African and Southeast Asian countries, where slum urbanization is accelerating, often have weak or only recently-emerging planning capacities.\",\"Access to early learning and pre-primary enrolment has grown in the past decade, but still 159 million children - over half of all three to six year olds - are missing out. It a place to learn and engage with civic development, to improve economic inclusion, social cohesion and environmental sustainability. It fosters disillusion and discontent, giving children the impression that there is no alternative to violence, often confronted with the choice to become a member of a gang or to never leave home.\",\"The gap between the richest and poorest urban quintile is at least 18 percentage points in half of the countries assessed, and in one-quarter of the countries it is 35 points or higher. This may be due in part to the fact that access to water and sanitation facilities helps determine a household's value on the wealth index that we use, see the Annex for further discussion of this matter. In half of the countries analysed, children in the poorest quintile are at least twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday as their richest urban peers. The relative disparity is even more pronounced for stunting, where prevalence in the poorest urban quintile is at least twice as high as for peers in the richest quintile in approximately 8 out of 10 of the countries analysed, and at least four times higher in 2 out of 10 countries. For both stunting and under-five mortality, relative inequality is higher in urban areas than in rural areas - a pattern opposite to that of the other indicators.\",\"Spatial integration of youth constitutes a major challenge in Africa, where poor and low-income youth are marginalized or excluded from employment opportunities and are often “trapped” within their neighbourhoods by virtue of ethnic, class, religious and other types of segregation. For example, the colloquial Swahili adopted by Tanzanian youth, especially in Dar es Salaam, should be drawn into the culture of the city rather than disparaged. Despite their critical role in African urban food security, informal urban agriculturalists are mostly tolerated rather than supported. In this respect, the protection of valuable urban agricultural lands from encroachment is a linked challenge, one which requires a response to the broader challenges of unplanned informal settlement growth.\",\"Spatial segregation in cities is sometimes stronger among the poorest households, as in Denmark and the Netherlands, other times among the richest, as in Canada, France and the United States (Chapter 4). Both configurations can undermine people’s chances to move up the income ladder. At the same time, cities also offer their residents the potential to break their path dependency towards their parents’ income.\",\"In 2014 manufactured goods accounted for 41.9 per cent of intra-African exports, compared with only 14.8 per cent of Africa’s exports outside the continent (UNECA and ODI, forthcoming)1. Regional economic communities are one forum where regionally significant policies and infrastructure can be planned, in line with national systems. Countries scoring high on the African Regional Integration Index in the category of infrastructure are listed in figure 4.9.\",\"Consequently, cities worldwide must take advantage of the need to redress existing deficiencies in housing, urban infrastructure and services, whilst simultaneously creating jobs and stimulating the urban economy. It stigmatizes and even removes large groups of the urban population from a socially and economically productive life (Box 1.2), and it excludes, by preventing them and their children from benefitting from opportunities to advance in the society at large. While inequality and exclusion are closely related as shown in Chapter 4, inequality has been at the centre of policy discussion. It is therefore gratifying that Goal 10 of the Sustainable Development Agenda seeks to reduce inequality within and among countries.\",\"The concept is purely relative, which means that under certain circumstances any good or service could become an inferior one. This means that even a luxury good or service can become inferior over time. Typically, inferior goods and services exist if in a consumer perception there are superior goods and services available.\",\"This leads to inefficient resource management that ignores the environmental impact of the waste, and in addition provides a commodity which is an economic resource to be taken advantage of. Children, who are already exposed to contaminated environments, bear the burden of poor waste management: as they will have to deal with the waste in the future. 'This results in polluted and unsafe settings, often in dense, informal settlements in urban and peri-urban areas.\",\"However, instead of bringing together far-flung networks and integrated (if virtual) urban expanses, ICTs instead splinter physical space into highly unequal, fragmented environments. The new feature is the juxtaposition of high-income enclaves with slums. Medellin, Colombia is segregated between the affluent South and the poor North, whereas in Mogadishu the polarization works the other way round.62 Inequality is more visible under a spatial than any other (e.g. income) perspective and the contrast of the “citadel\\\" with the “ghetto\\\"63 can generate mistrust, alienation, tension or unrest. Today, videos carry the voices of local stakeholders to planning offices and federal agencies, giving them a reach, which would not have possible without the use of technology.\",\"Both growth and inequality in cities manifest themselves in terms of income, but also across major dimensions of people’s well-being, such as jobs and health. But a person’s zip code shapes much more of their life than their mere income. Life expectancies differ by almost 20 years across neighbourhoods in Baltimore (Baltimore City Health Department, 2015) or London (Cheshire, 2012).\",\"Living in multiple places produces functional spaces that often do not correspond to administrative boundaries (Cortes and Fayet, 2009, Ma Mung, 1999). This mobility gradually results in a rural economy that is more diversified and often related to some form of urban economy (Haggblade, Hazell and Reardon, 2007). About 40% of African urban dwellers are “engaged in some sort of agricultural activity\\\" (FAO, 2012).\",\"With around 883 million urban dwellers living in slums and many others yet to be measured facing inadequate and unaffordable housing, this indicator is strongly associated with other social challenges such as low educational attainment, crime, and poor well-being. The Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000 and the enabling approach have dominated housing policies since Habitat II and the 1996 Habitat Agenda, which rests on two pillars: housing for all, and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world. Today more than 100 countries have a constitutional provision on the right to adequate housing.\",\"This poses significant indirect costs to firms, underlined by an observation about firms in Kenya: \\\"By some estimates, Kenya’s factory floor productivity is close to China’s, but once we account for indirect costs, Kenyan firms lose 40 per cent of their productivity advantage” (larossi, 2009, p. 87).20 Informal firms often most need access to infrastructure and public services to upgrade productivity, but face the highest barriers to access. Firms in Africa lose up to 13 per cent of their working hours due to outages. Electricity costs African firms 10 per cent of sales costs, with 6 per cent estimated to be due to power outages (larossi, 2009).\",\"Abject poverty is the norm in Kibera, and people have limited access to basic social services. The land on which Kibera slum stands is owned by the government, 90 per cent of residents are tenants and only 10 per cent of residents are shack owners and many of these people own other shacks that they rent out. The average size of a shack in Kibera is less than 14 sq.\",\"Once assembled there, the items are exported to high-end markets. The firms belong in the formal sector, not the workers. In Tunisia, during the country's fastest growth period, over 54 per cent of the labour force consisted of informal workers who were subcontracted by large export-oriented formal enterprises.9 Amongst these informal workers, females are predominant, being preferred over males for a number of reasons: willingness to work for lower wages, lower propensity to organize compared with male workers, and higher degrees of pliancy.\",\"These eastern cites are now economically and ethnically segregated from central Paris: the peripheral suburbs are characterized by poverty, a high share of public housing, and low education levels. Labourers and the unemployed are overrepresented among households in this region (Clerval et Delage 2014), and many of the residents are Algerian, Moroccan, and sub-Saharan African immigrants or descendants. The French government has labelled 731 of these neighborhoods zones urbaines sensibles (“sensitive urban zones”), which makes them a high-priority target for policy intervention.\",\"Africa has achieved the same transformation in almost half the time: 60 years. Africa’s urbanisation is estimated to have gained 5.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2015, second only to Asia, which gained 10.7 percentage points during the same period. In 2015, almost 472 million Africans lived in urban areas (authors’ calculations based on UN DESA, 2014). The size of Africa’s urban population nearly doubled in 20 years from 237 million in 1995 to 472 million in 2015.\",\"Without serious and concerted action on the part of municipal authorities, national governments, civil society actors and the international community, the numbers of slum dwellers are likely to increase in most developing countries. A number of accounts of the appalling living conditions in slums and informal settlements were published during this period.53 A recent analysis examines the history and planning architecture behind various stalled attempts to redevelop the Dharavi district in Mumbai - a vast area with nearly 750,000 people. If the grand visions of master planners -referred to by many in Mumbai as hallucinations - were realized, then the social dislocations they would bring about would be unimaginable.\",\"For children, it means unhealthy and unsafe environments, limited options for walking and playing, limited connectivity to social networks, services and local economy. Although mostly overlooked, inequity has a spatial dimension that makes children vulnerable. Spatial inequity manifests itself in various ways and reveals the importance of land value, land tenure, land use and the planning and management of the spatial characteristics of the built environment.\",\"Slums swelled at the same time as new settlements appeared. Since 1998, the sector has been revitalised through the introduction of a tax linked to sales of cement, which will provide financial resources to the Fonds Social de l'Habitat (FSH), which provides a levy of 15 centimes\\u002fkg (Fawzi Zniber, 2015). It involved 324 000 households (1.6 million inhabitants) in more than a thousand districts in 85 cities, of which nearly a third concentrated in the Casablanca agglomeration alone (AFD, 2011).\",\"It was recently used in Salt Lake County to expand high-quality' voluntary pre-kindergarten to 600 economically disadvantaged children in the Granite School District. Financial partnerships also need to include effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms. Digitalisation can promote more efficient and more equitable access to some public services such as healthcare, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Access to broadband has also become key to facilitating people’s integration in the labour market and in their community' at large.\",\"The NHDS could be revised to include informal settlement and upgrading of existing housing stocks both in its objectives and subsequent implementation measures. Furthermore, overall housing objectives could be re-oriented to focus not only on the quantitative targets but also on the provision of adequate and accessible housing. Although wide spread slums do not exist in Viet Nam, there is reference to “vertical slums,” which are multifloor buildings which are divided into small living spaces and rented to the low income market. Given the financial constraint in the public sector, incremental upgrading and maintenance of the existing housing stock by individuals could be encouraged.\",\"Between 2000 and 2013, Africa’s agricultural sector has maintained a real growth rate of 5.1% per year, well above the population growth rate of 2.7%. Africa’s food system is fundamentally changing, and urbanisation plays a central role in this process. Urbanisation i) creates upward demand for food production in Africa, ii) increases efficiency in post-farm segments, and iii) transforms the rural on-farm and non-farm economy (Reardon and Timmer, 2014).\",\"The relative wealth disparity metric is instead intended to shed light on the inequalities in the conditions facing the richest and poorest in urban and rural areas of the same country. In contrast, in rural areas the gap of approximately 41 percentage points for low-income countries only halves to approximately 22 percentage points for upper-middle income countries. However, it is also partly explained by the observed greater wealth of urban households. Among a separate sample of 88 countries, on average, 83 per cent of the richest quintile lives in urban areas, with just 17 per cent in rural areas (unweighted averages).\",\"Following an overview of the world’s urban landscape, Chapter 2 looks at the status of children in urban settings through the lens of international human rights instruments and development goals. Chapter 3 examines some of the phenomena shaping the lives of children in urban areas, from their reasons for coming to the city and their experience of migration to the challenges posed by economic shocks, violence and acute disaster risk. Many cities have been able to contain or banish diseases that were widespread only a generation ago.\",\"Where informal settlements were established on vacant land, people were able to build their own homes. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions facilitate the transmission of disease - including pneumonia and diarrhoea, the two leading killers of children younger than 5 worldwide. Outbreaks of measles, tuberculosis and other vaccine-preventable diseases are also more frequent in these areas, where population density is high and immunization levels are low.\",\"The World Bank and UN-Habitat have defined a cut-off point at which owner-occupied or rental housing is deemed unaffordable, which has been used for tracking housing affordability over time as part of the agency’s Urban Indicators Programme. Housing is generally deemed affordable when a household spends less than 30 pet cent of their income on housing-related expenses, such as mortgage repayments (owners), rent payments(renters), and direct operational expenses such as taxes, insurance and service payments. Except for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), all subregions with significant slum prevalence recorded higher slum growth than the global urban population change average, with the highest rates recorded in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at 3.9 per cent and South-East Asia at 3.0 per cent.\\\"'\",\"For most analyses in this report, this sorting is done separately for urban and rural households and compares the bottom quintile (the poorest) with the top quintile (the richest). This report mostly uses the former. Relative inequality is given as the ratio of the indicator value for the two groups. But in both cases, the same amount of investment or effort may be needed to increase the service coverage by 5 percentage points.\",\"In pursuit of that ambition, this chapter analyses the diversity and uniqueness of the continent’s urbanisation experiences. Chapters 7 and 8 then focus on options for seizing the opportunities that urbanisation provides. An annex to Chapter 6 explains the methodology for the cluster analysis on urbanisation and structural transformation in diverse African countries. Africa’s urbanisation can allow for structural transformation, if accompanied by productive employment and sufficient public goods.\",\"The built environment also reveals itself as a threat when children and their caretakers cannot evaluate risks, be prepared or be safe. Given the global trend in urbanization, there is significant potential to engage with children in the decisions that affect their physical urban environment, their interaction with urban resource systems and shape their behaviour. The recognition of childhood as a crucial time for children to gain access to the urban setting and enjoy its advantages, is key to define spatial solutions for all ages. Child-responsive urban settings resonate qualities that many scholars have described as conceptual standards for sustainable neighbourhoods and cities: urban scales, proximity, walkability, mixed use, public space, independent mobility and connectivity. Planning urban space at various scales. Area-based urban programmes enable better service delivery for children, as well as a clean and safe built environment.\",\"Increased trade, labour mobility and innovation in communications have spread urban functions and influence over wide geographical areas, including rural ones. Yet, in the case of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, censuses and surveys that consider the urban\\u002frural dichotomy are still valid since they persistently indicate social inequalities subsisting between rural and urban areas (United Nations, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2012). Still, some of the most profound social inequalities are seen within cities or within nations' urban populations.\",\"The project had a strong community involvement and appears to have incorporated lessons from earlier slum upgrading projects (HUDCC, 2014). The Baan Mankong slum upgrading in Bangkok, Thailand, allows for the integration of slum dwellers into society through a demand-side approach (Archer, 2012). Baan Mankong is implemented by the Community Organisations Development Institute (CODI) and allows for community organisations established by informal settlement residents to be the managers in developing and planning solutions to their housing problems.\",\"There, through integration of locally generated community based information, co-production of urban planning strategies and social engagement in public sector interventions, the programme achieved a dramatic decrease in crime. By improving access to public spaces, enhancing lighting and visibility, setting up social and business centres along walkways, pedestrian traffic, community surveillance and social cohesion increased. Playtime in Africa creates places for children to convene in a safe outdoor environment to play, learn and create. The initiative combines best practices from around the world and integrates them into local conditions to develop a strategy for child-focused places.\",\"A long and healthy life for all South Africans.

Guidance should include how to engage all stakeholders in the integration process, how to perform a comprehensive risk analysis, how to adjust current programming and thus integrate resilience into donor country and national government strategies, and, importantly, how to evaluate the impact of resilience-building.

In some ways, this has always been well recognized. What is new in today's increasingly interconnected society is the diversity and complexity of threats and hazards, and the complex interaction among them, which result in \\\"an unprecedented global creation of risks, often due to previous socioeconomic development trends interacting with existing and new development dynamics and emerging global threats.\",\"For example, Food-for-Work, Cash-for Work and Canteen feeding are routinely used to treat structural vulnerability-to-disaster issues such as environmental degradation and gender. These are incompatible with the long-term and sustainable measures required accompanied by predictable donor investment. Further, efforts to increase commercial agriculture are prioritised at the expense of investment of small producers, again, propped up by a continuing reliance on external investment.\",\"This provides a powerful impetus for the \\\"traditional\\\" DRR community, seeking to redress practice that has for many years seen ex ante action articulating the complex risk drivers from which disasters materialize eclipsed by action responding to the manifestation of disasters. Translating this shift into informed, systems-based decision-making, investment and practice in all contexts and at all scales, and reflecting this in local to national strategies, is arguably the principal preoccupation of this community. Contexts in which humanitarian response427 and DRR428 are implemented are therefore more complicated and challenging than is often acknowledged or represented in policy and programmatic documents.\",\"Therefore, risk should be seen as a normal and inseparable part of economic activities and development, as something built into particular development pathways and practices, constructed through day-to-day decisions by those who have a stake in particular patterns of development. It needs to ensure that development is risk informed to improve the safety of people and critical facilities, to protect the natural and built environment, and to build resilient livelihoods and economic activity. Prospective measures to prevent or reduce risk creation can be combined with corrective DRM efforts that reduce the level of existing risk (e.g. through retrofitting of critical infrastructure such as schools or hospitals). Compensatory risk management activities also have a role in strengthening the social and economic resilience of individuals and societies in the face of residual risk (the remaining risk that cannot be effectively eliminated), for example through preparedness, response and recovery activities, contingent credit, insurance and safety net programmes that are designed to help affected populations mitigate disasters or recover from their impacts.\",\"Harmonized efforts also lessen the possibility that different groups inadvertently duplicate efforts or fall short of meeting even immediate life-sustaining needs. Complexity demands that all actors must act together as partners on the front-line systemic risk reduction. In Afghanistan, the National Afghanistan Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction calls for DRR to be mainstreamed into development planning, sectoral plans, capacity-building, CCA, livelihood security, gender mainstreaming, community empowerment, and response and recovery management. It aims to improve coherence and integration in efforts to reduce the risks posed by disasters, climate change, conflict and fragility, with other development imperatives, and places this at the centre of the pursuit of the achievement of the outcome and goals of the post-2015 international agreements and frameworks, including the SDGs.\",\"To date, 10 public policies related to planning and investment in different sectors (urban, rural and natural resource management) have benefited from DRR mainstreaming. Both issues are recognized in the Resilience and Disaster Risk Management Strategic Framework and Investment Program 2015, which will operationalize the country's National Development Plan 2015-2020. For example, in Indonesia, the 2007 Disaster Management Law made subnational governments at provincial, district and subdistrict levels responsible for DRR integration into development programmes, requiring them to allocate sufficient funding to do so. Pilot projects on DRR planning were implemented at the community level, which were expected to feed into village level development plans, which were to inform development planning processes at the subdistrict and district level.\",\"In the Arab region, UNISDR has continued to promote the \\\"Making Cities Resilient\\\" campaign to support urban areas to become more resilient to disasters.

Next, donors will need to apply resilience building elements to existing and new programming, standalone resilience projects or programmes are probably less useful in the long-term. Donors will also need to take care that resilience building in one layer of society, or in one sector, does not undermine the resilience of another layer or sector.\",\"Due to highly arid conditions, the region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change, putting cities at risk of water scarcity and extreme heat conditions. However, it was found that the \\\"underlying risks of humanitarian crisis and disasters challenge the process of building resilience in the Arab region, combined with the lack of coping capacities when faced with climate change, conflict, and displacement. City-wide hazard maps are often limited or do not exist, while updates on risk assessment are scarce and lack clear multi-hazard components, according to a recent assessment.410 This challenge is often linked to disaster risk governance, when the legal framework fails to require the maintenance and updating of disaster data.\",\"If large-scale hazardous events and outliers are excluded disaster mortality triggered by hydrometeorological hazards can be observed in an upward trend, as shown in figure 15. These variations call for deeper analysis of each sector and kinds of disasters, for informed policymaking.

Bandung’s approach to hazard assessment could expand upon that of other Southeast Asian cities such as Cebu (Box 2.1).\",\"Furthermore, as the data collection, analysis and diagnosis stages take into account ongoing plans, policies and programmes in the city, the resulting Actions for Resilience in Maputo will be more easily integrated into existing urban development strategies as opposed to an isolated resilience action plan that might not be joined with other initiatives in the city. This process will allow integration with the Ecosystem Based Adaptation Plan and the Metropolitan Transport Project, as well as relevant new policies, plans and agreements that are currently being developed at the municipal level. Commitment of a local government lead with a clear mandate and the necessary authorities is the first step to local-level DRR action. However, urban risk governance is a more complex than merely having the necessary legislation and institutions in place, it requires broad participation for effective implementation.\",\"The Health Sector Support Project helped to further develop disease surveillance and outbreak response capacities of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

This will require adopting \\\"good practice principles in risk-informed development\\\" such as inclusive and transparent, phased and iterative, flexible and adaptive, continuous learning and reflection approaches.470 Making development choices that support development trajectories that harness benefits for reduced complex risk, avoid risk creation and better manage residual risk, must be the way forward. Regional platforms for DRR and other innovative regional multi-stakeholder partnerships play an important role in DRR awareness and cooperation.\",\"They both have a long history of sustaining considerable losses from the impact of disasters, although Vanuatu has a higher risk of humanitarian crises and disasters than Dominica, based on the Index for Risk Management. Nevertheless, both countries are considered to have a high resilience to external shocks and are categorised as 'high vulnerable and high resilience' countries according to Briguglio's (2014) revised vulnerability\\u002fresilience framework. There is also commonality and diversity in other aspects.\",\"This confusion is fed by a lack of differentiation between 'resilience' as a political agenda, as described above, versus 'resilience' as a technical approach that offers added value on top of existing risk management approaches. They are not the same thing, yet both are necessary to ensure that resilience is successfully implemented, and that it complements, rather than replaces, proven best practices. The 'agenda' should provide the vehicle to implement the ‘technical approach'. The great obstacles for realising the potential of resilience result from the multitude of interpretations of what resilience is, and lack of agreement in how to go about building resilience that addresses the risk attached to the full range of shocks and stresses, and the uncertainty of these, that people, communities and nations face. Demonstrating the interconnectedness of different risks and how these may differ between individual, community and national 'layers', in order to provide a rationale for approaching resilience as a truly holistic methodology.\",\"Vanuatu: 2015 Article IV consultation and request for disbursement under the rapid credit facility and purchase under the rapid financing instrument—press release, staff report, and statement by the Executive Director for Vanuatu', IMF Country Report No. Press release: IMF Executive Board approves US$8.7 million disbursement under the rapid credit facility for Dominica', 28 October 2015, Press Release No. Vanuatu: 2016 Article IV consultation - press release, staff report: and statement by the Executive Director for Vanuatu', IMF Country Report No. Dominica: Selected issues'.\",\"Consequently, Dominica faces a high risk of debt distress in contrast to the previously moderate risk (IMF 2013a, 2016a). Dominica suffered considerably from the impact of Category 5 Hurricane Maria, which was probably even more substantial than Hurricane Erika, while Vanuatu had to undertake a massive relocation exercise of 11,000 people on account ofthe threat ofthe volcanic eruption on the island of Ambae. Both countries have similar physical island characteristics in terms of climate and vegetation, but, whereas Dominica consists of one island, Vanuatu is a group of around 80 islands. As a result of their island geography and locations in the Caribbean and the Pacific, respectively, both countries are highly vulnerable to multiple hazards, such as cyclones, earthquakes, flooding, volcanic activity and associated tsunami threats.\",\"As a result of this bottom-up mainstreaming initiative, the Ministry of Finance and National Planning has started to make decisions based on the community needs and priorities outlined in community development plans. Many countries report financial constraints as the main barrier to mainstreaming and that these explain the lack of progress in reducing underlying risks nationally and locally.298The low level of financing reflects a lack of overall means in many countries, but it also reflects perceptions and priorities of governments and donors on where investment should be made. Historically investment that supports long-term resilience tends to lose out to investment focused on shorter-term goals. The latter is not always straightforward, as risk reduction measures are not always clearly labelled as such, take investment in forestry management in areas exposed to high levels of landslide risk for example.\",\"Topics can cover international finance and capital markets, international trade, the environment, natural disasters, macroeconomic management, and economic and social development. Submissions should not exceed 1,500 words. Reader feedback, publication announcements and notices of upcoming events should reach the Commissioning Editor two weeks ahead of publication.\",\"It is also supporting national governments to organize similar national and sub-national meetings. Local governments, and their local partners, are imparting skills to enable effective use of tools such as the Disaster Resilience Scorecard for cities. They are also providing a simple methodology that can support development of DRR plans from the Scorecard's outputs.\",\"Working to narrow institutional mandates no longer makes sense. ' Climate resilience' can be compromised where geopolitical risks are not taken into account in insecure and fragile states. Similarly, disaster preparedness is of little use if it is not directly connected to other initiatives covering a range of shocks. Further, resilience in one sector e.g. food and nutrition security, can be undermined by a lack of similar investment in other sectors, such as clean water. Donors can play a leading role in setting the record straight on this, by breaking down barriers between existing programming silos, in turn leading to a more helpful and harmonised engagement in resilience from those actors dependent on donor resources (i.e. realising the expectations of the resilience agenda).\",\"They also had similar challenges, particularly around logistics and transportation, as well as coordination of efforts on the ground. However, in terms of learning from their experiences, while both countries conducted workshops to review the lessons learnt, only Vanuatu produced a detailed report with practical recommendations forthe government to pursue. This is further evidence of Vanuatu's strong commitment to disaster risk reduction and management compared with Dominica.\",\"This coordination can be carried out in formal and informal capacities. Because risk within this perspective is understood as polycentric, no one risk takes priority over the others. The removal of a specific risk may not fundamentally alter the system, and the manifestation of one risk has the potential to trigger other risks within the system.\",\"The CCRIF is designed as a regional catastrophe fund for Caribbean governments to limit the financial impact of natural disasters by quickly providing financial liquidity when a policy is triggered. The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) was also launched in 2007, but its Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot was rolled out in 2013. The PCRAFI's other core component is a technical assistance and capacity-building programme on disaster risk financing and insurance, including public financial management of disasters.\",\"The present political context, however, could call into question much of what has been achieved. The prolonged absence of support from technical and financial partners has negative consequences for the country and risks endangering the progress that has been made, particularly in social dimensions. Renewed engagement by these participants is largely dependent on a political solution to political tensions, which would make it possible to avoid an even more serious deterioration in the socio-economic situation. The whole international community is worried by the persistent tensions in the country, which also carry risks for the entire sub-region.\",\"The Vanuatu Government also suspended value-added tax (VAT) and import duties on construction materials for two months after the cyclone, deferred payments of vehicle registration fees and VAT to the next quarter, and provided subsidies for agricultural seedlings to affected households (IMF 2016b). The Vanuatu National Provident Fund also allowed its 40,000 active members to withdraw up to 20 per cent of their retirement savings to cover expenses related to Cyclone Pam (IMF 2016b). Common to both were the significant logistics and transportation challenges due to the isolation of numerous communities and challenging geographical terrain (SPC 2016: IFRC 2017). There were also coordination challenges, particularly data flow and information management coordination from the national disaster offices\\u002fcoordinating bodies (SPC 2016: IFRC 2017).\",\"On the other hand, Dominica's pre-existing conditions limited its options and fell far short of meeting the total costs of Hurricane Erika, even though those costs have probably been underestimated. This is despite both countries being eligible for overseas development assistance (ODA).16 as well as having similar eligibility criteria for grants from IFIs (see Table 5). From a bilateral perspective, one of the reasons could be that Vanuatu has a much closer political relationship with its major bilateral donor, Australia, than the relationship between Dominica and Japan, its major bilateral donor.\",\"In 2017, the government further systemized its risk assessment work through the National Disaster Risk and Vulnerability Atlas, which will shape the second National Development Plan. Private utilities are often at the forefront when it comes to risk assessment and taking measures to protect their services. Government is also made up of a myriad of sectors and departments, interests, powers and knowledge bases that need to be well understood to be effectively deployed in the process.\",\"For example, particular vulnerabilities in WASH systems may be expressed when health systems in a politically unstable country falter during a rainy season. Even within a given context, there are many ways that DRR can respond to the complex interplay among risks, which also points to the necessity of adaptive management. While complex systems are challenging to address, much less understand, the application of a nuanced understanding of systemic risk to local to national DRR strategies provides for expanded opportunities to achieve the goals set forth in the Sendai Framework.\",\"Both governments are guided by national development plans, with similar priorities around socio-economic measures and the environment. Their local government arrangements reflect the urban concentration (Dominica) and rural spread (Vanuatu) of their populations. In addition, for Vanuatu, the state's reach is weak outside the urban centres and power is vested in churches and the traditional chiefly system. Corruption in government has also been more an issue for Vanuatu than for Dominica.\",\"At the same time, disasters themselves can create unstable economic conditions, exacerbate social fault lines and heighten social exclusion - creating fertile ground for conflict. Compared with natural disasters, which are one-off and sometimes rapid events, conflicts tend to last longer. Nevertheless, conflicts and disasters both compound risks to create complex and converging crises, so they can be considered together.\",\"Vanuatu also had a better pre-disaster position than Dominica, as it had significantly lower debt levels and had a wider range of disaster-financing instruments at its disposal. On the other hand, Dominica's pre-existing conditions limited its options and fell far short of meeting the total costs of Hurricane Erika, even though those costs have probably been underestimated. Moreover, to Vanuatu's advantage, bilateral and multilateral donors were more responsive to relief and reconstruction efforts than for Dominica, where the government found it more difficult to secure donor grant funding.\",\"Thanks to a massive scale-up in humanitarian assistance, famine was averted, but it remains a looming risk in the future. Large parts of the drought-affected rural areas in southern and central Somalia were controlled by al Shabaab and were inaccessible to the government and most humanitarian organizations and international actors. To assess drought impacts under these circumstances and guarantee the personal security of staff, humanitarian actors relied on remote assessment methods that combined remote-sensing technologies and social media analytics.\",\"Disaster risk reduction and resilience must be systematically embedded into agricultural development plans and investments - particularly in countries facing recurrent disasters and where agriculture is a critical source of livelihoods, food security and nutrition if no one is to be left behind. Strategies for achieving resilient agriculture include: boosting agricultural productivity with stress-tolerant varieties, adjusting planting dates, expanding water harvesting, storage, and conservation, and insurance and social protection schemes for farmers. Many ofthe same measures that will make communities and households more resilient to disasters can also act as stepping stones out of poverty.\",\"With little in the way of practical policy guidance on how to navigate changing conflict contexts, many countries find the legislative approval of DRR laws halted - as was the case for Fiji and Nepal.431 In other contexts, increased insecurity can lead to DRR programmes being temporarily suspended. This has been the case in the Central African Republic (CAR). The violent conflict and political crisis that began in 2013 has provoked humanitarian impacts that have led to large-scale human displacement, degradation of the education system, negative impacts on sanitation and access to water, and food insecurity.\",\"In Bangladesh, the sudden and large-scale nature of the Rohingya refugee crisis led to deforestation and increased risk of flash flooding and landslides. The impacts of climate change, which increase the risk factors for extreme and unpredictable weather patterns and events, also contribute to environmental fragility. Widespread heat-waves stretch humanitarian and health systems and point to the necessity of preparing institutions to reach the most vulnerable. The tenuous security situation makes DRR activities more challenging.\",\"In addressing systemic risk, the national strategy also includes a variety of programmes and plans to combat poverty and enhance societal resilience to reduce the risk of disasters and cascading impacts. Communities at particular and persistent risk of disasters include communities located near rivers, in close proximity to flood-prone dams, in low-lying areas prone to flooding during heavy rains, along seismically active zones and in areas affected by conflict. It has taken these as the foci for its national strategy and risk reduction measures, addressing IWRM and the security context, as well as the environmental, climatic, social, cultural and political context.\",\"Therefore, it is seen as a more effective way of consuming funding lines compared to longer-term mitigation and prevention actions. However, using short-term mechanisms and approaches to address the structural issues at the heart of risk is only able to resolve the symptoms rather than addressing root causes. Further, the focus on food and nutrition security as the overall objective of risk management dangerously oversimplifies the risk landscape faced by people.\",\"So should the risk-informed development approach called for in the Sendai Framework, through the systematic integration of risk information across all sectoral planning processes. Delivering DRR is possible in any context, but the scope of what is viable and appropriate will change depending on the context. And for some, such as those affected by armed conflict and fragility, what this looks like is still to be learned.469 There remains a dearth of practical and policy advice on how to devise and implement DRR strategies for complex risk contexts, including where violent conflict forms part of the broader environment in which DRR takes place.\",\"Cultural aspects linked to family are equally challenging for addressing the vulnerability to disaster in poor families of Niger, where the role of women is considered of very little importance, and where the sale and marriage of child brides is a widespread financial coping mechanism for families, particularly in times of hardship. This has resulted in dispersed risk management initiatives, duplicated efforts, and multiplied the need for contacts and negotiation with different parties. It also makes scaling up good practice more difficult. There are two main reasons behind this lack of partnership.\",\"Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) play a role in creating smart, sustainable and resilient cities and overcoming financing constraints. However, it is important that such partnerships are designed in way that they are not a source of risk to public finances and that affordability and inclusiveness considerations are duly taken into account. While the value for money concept remains important, with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the challenge is to implement PPPs according to a broader set of holistic criteria and undertake projects that from inception to termination create 'value for people'. The action plan for implementation of a National Disaster Risk Management Programme for period 2017-2020 was adopted by the Government in March 2017. The plan was coordinated by the Public Investment Management Office -with participation of all line ministries, special organizations, local self-governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders in the countiy. Along with the action plan, a Disaster Risk Financing Programme has also been adopted.\",\"The multidimensional nature of these commitments, and more importantly the underlying risks they address, require systems-based approaches, including in assessing needs and making national and local decisions about the most effective use of available resources. The objective is to identify the enablers and opportunities, as well as the barriers to integrated risk governance, which may come in the form of legislative mandates, institutional structures, capacity, resources, social equality\\u002fvulnerability, gender roles, people's awareness and habits of thinking about risk. This could also be described as an integrated risk governance assessment, taking into account multiple hazards (man-made, natural and mixed) and related risks, the way hazards, vulnerability and economic activity interacts with the environment and with each other within and among complex systems, and the need to adapt policy and implementation to enable systems-based approaches to risk reduction. It can also be hard to imagine what success looks like in the face of so many demands.\",\"The IMF’s rapid financing instrument (RFI)'.

Just as important, all new projects should be disaster resistant not only in their structural components, but also in their impacts on society, livelihoods and the environment. This can be offset to a certain extent by international aid.\",\"When a disaster occurs, based on the functions and tasks of the branches and units, the Committee is responsible for co-ordination, creating favourable conditions for the effective collaboration of all agencies in the response activities. Members of the committee are heads of Hai Phong departments, agencies and government units. Every year, they are asked to prepare local plans for natural disaster prevention and submit them to the committee so it can prepare a master plan for the whole city.\",\"These in turn are divorced from the less common initiatives to counter economic and geopolitical risk. Again, the focus is on large drought, locust invasion and animal disease shocks, with priority placed on food and nutrition security as the overall objective of risk management. Undeniably, these are the critical issues affecting those most vulnerable to disaster, however this prioritisation, at the expense of other risks and risk management approaches, means that flooding, human epidemics (and pandemics) and other (non-negligible) economic and geopolitical risks are inadequately addressed or are siloed from the predominant drought risk management programming in Niger. The disproportional focus on using shorter-term instruments at the expense of longer-term development (as outlined in Section 4.1) is replicated in risk management programming, reinforced by the prioritisation of food and nutrition security and preparedness, traditionally led by humanitarian actors.\",\"It is also part of the IGAD Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative (IDDRSI), for the period of 2013 to 2027, and has its own national plan within this process. It also discusses forced displacement as a cause and consequence of this, across borders and within countries. Technical experts (e.g. agronomists, meteorologists, veterinarians and water engineers), funded by international organizations, have worked on issues related to drought and its effects on pastoralism and agriculture for many years.\",\"However, there is a growing number of countries that have made strides in this direction. For example, in Ethiopia, the Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance has developed a training programme for government and civil society organizations to mainstream DRR and CCA. District DRM committees headed by the Chief District Administrative Officer brought together stakeholders to discuss and understand the potential threats, hazards, disaster-prone areas and identification and mobilization of resources to implement DRR options. The discussions drew on information from Uganda's damage and loss database that has 30 years of historical data.\",\"Other aspects of risk - including how to target extensive, everyday risks - also need to be better understood. Risk management and resilience criteria should be part of all budget allocation processes. A 'tagging and tracing' methodology, that allows the tracking and calculation of allocated funds, could, therefore, be beneficial. Building resilience aspects into concessional loans may provide a useful additional funding stream.\",\"The probability that recurrent emergencies will persist is high, even with well-planned and executed strategies. However, over time and with dedicated attention and often incremental action, complex disaster risks can be managed and reduced. Coordinated, collaborative action allows for organizations to play to their strengths and not extend beyond their own institutional capacity while also creating synergies and positive exchanges among actors.\",\"The camps have minimal access to basic infrastructure and services, and are prone to natural hazards, especially cyclones, floods and landslides. Setting up the camps has led to rapid deforestation, further increasing the vulnerability of the displaced Rohingya to the effects of monsoon rains. These investments address health, education and emergency response.\",\"Finally, indicators to measure changes in the components of the resilient systems will need to be developed, so that the overall impact of efforts to strengthen resilience can be measured. Other significant disincentives include the lack of a natural or centralised 'home' for risk management in partner government structures, the lack of absorption capacity of government structures (particularly at the local level), fragmented legal and legislative structures, local cultural factors, problematic access to risk information, insecurity, and economic barriers. The way donors plan and implement programmes can also create powerful disincentives, including uncoordinated planning cycles between the donor and partner governments, centralised decision-making, the separation of humanitarian and development programming, a perception that risk is 'complicated', fragmented risk management approaches spread across different institutional divisions, the lack of penetration or risk management and resilience into quality control, evaluation and administrative\\u002ffunding processes, contradictory career incentives, and risk aversion in donor investments.\",\"But droughts also affected 13 million people. Beyond the fatalities, many more people have been affected, since 1970 a person living in the Asia-Pacific region has been five times more likely to be affected by natural disasters than a person living outside the region. Between 1970 and 2016, Asia and the Pacific lost $1.3 trillion in assets.\",\"Intergovernmental organizations in most hazard-prone regions have developed cooperation on DRM, but a more active promotion of regional and national risk reduction is a role they could take on more strongly, for example by focusing on: (a) regional risk assessment and reduction, (b) the needs of SIDS, small countries and least developed countries for practical support in building capacity and risk information systems, and (c) risk financing mechanisms. This requires a review of the enabling legislation and the institutional frameworks, which often encourage working in silos rather than cross-sectorally and vertically from local to national levels. The enabling frameworks at national level are also the principal mechanism to ensure that the needs of vulnerable groups and the principles of equality and participation are integrated, especially for women and youth. Target E of the Sendai Framework does not necessarily require additional separate plans, but it does require countries to review existing DRR strategies in light of the Sendai Framework and ensure that local strategies dovetail with national level.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"6_risk_resilience_disaster\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"6_risk_resilience_disaster\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[-1.3210015,-1.2140121,-1.4199171,-1.9454199,-1.6239971,-1.2691596,-1.9134015,-1.8813666,-1.9557285,-1.3372922,-1.2050716,-1.5690755,-1.4154953,-1.576056,-1.5656366,-1.2805918,-1.3179618,-1.2438077,-1.2479255,-1.3450633,-1.2083895,-1.3306252,-1.3634511,-1.4570142,-1.9452794,-1.5992373,-1.9391319,-1.3160602,-1.9371444,-1.9481939,-1.294421,-1.1803049,-1.5823438,-1.3344103,-1.9203726,-1.4662206,-1.607897,-1.517875,-1.9330951,-1.9577769,-1.4055728,-1.5767726,-1.955244,-1.315937,-1.9703386,-1.2729528,-1.2700949,-1.5529298,-1.298638,-1.397692,-1.3058517,-1.5952791,-1.3688055,-1.6094143,-1.4033016,-1.9155761,-1.3418658,-1.5436702,-1.3102674,-1.3446995,-1.5677657,-1.3077612,-1.454737,-1.2913148,-1.3124255,-1.2227188,-1.5336559,-1.5064553],\"y\":[2.392773,2.2615519,2.360037,1.8004994,2.4328957,2.2681527,1.8481983,1.8892775,1.7932572,2.3798785,2.275481,2.4040282,2.3825805,2.4162133,2.4379175,2.6878986,2.351638,2.5778556,2.2890718,2.3579323,2.2778518,2.5336876,2.5626874,2.5176425,1.8050141,2.4143417,1.80591,2.4066224,1.8156552,1.8009742,2.4198956,2.689982,2.4254384,2.396275,1.830955,2.346373,2.2305517,2.4177477,1.8194513,1.7909487,2.3778827,2.3933773,1.7945056,2.2946577,1.7774729,2.3267887,2.3258438,2.4051745,2.3353112,2.4213579,2.3029006,2.415704,2.3298836,2.3323789,2.3653634,1.847084,2.5304785,2.5710433,2.3140886,2.349283,2.402828,2.2928243,2.351002,2.281942,2.3826659,2.2489853,2.4554126,2.270767],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"In spite of this difficult climate, there was a significant improvement in the management of public finances thanks in particular to the substantial efforts undertaken by the transition authorities and the support of the technical and financial partners (TFP).

Thus, there is a significant capacity-building issue required in order to ensure that all local authorities have the ability, resources and buy-in to realise the planning objectives through the tools at hand. This raises the question of finances. As the role of intercommunalites grows in importance, their fiscal resources will need to keep pace with these functions. This in turn increases the importance of transparent and accountable political authority at this scale.\",\"These reforms are a “step in the right direction” towards simplifying the millefeuille territorial (OECD, 2015b). Both Fiance, the United Kingdom and Germany have such competency clauses, which are related to the idea of subsidiarity (that decision making authority should be ascribed to those at the lowest level of government in order to be closer to communities and residents). There are a number of caveats to the clause. For example, in France, subnational governments can take on tasks that are not formally ascribed to them if these tasks are not part of the obligatory responsibilities of another level of government.\",\"They are costly, complex, typically land intensive and for all of these reasons, involve risk. Given this, meaningful public engagement in decision making is an important part of the policy process. This entails raising public awareness of about the scope, cost, location and timeframes for a project early on in the process so as to gather information and opinions on various elements. At its most involved level, such engagement practices include citizens in some element of decision making. For example, including the opinions and ideas of citizens (or stakeholders) in a project can lead to more and better information with which to design or deliver a project.\",\"Subnational governments often understand local specificities better than national governments. They can also better engage their constituents, which fosters inclusiveness. With a clear understanding of who should do what, different actors can work together and reduce inefficiencies and misaligned policies.\",\"On the other hand, they embrace the idea that subnational authorities should have the freedom to take initiatives on matters that are important to their constituencies. They comment that the various subnational authorities have “overlapping jurisdictions and loosely defined spheres of competence” and that, even where there is a clear division of responsibilities, “they are not always respected” (Wienen and Mosler-Tomstrom, 2016: 41). This potential for overlapping responsibilities stems from the fact that there is no formal hierarchy among subnational authorities—“in theory', no single authority can impose its will on any other” (Wienen and Mosler-Tomstrom, 2016: 41). Local governments have resources that they are free to use. Tax revenues and the local governments’ own resources from other sources must represent a decisive share of these resources. This means that local governments must not depend on the central government for the majority of their resources (see below).\",\"Credibility is enhanced when laws are culturally resonant and enforceable. It equally requires responsive, transparent and accountable government at the local level. Civic engagement and responsible government both necessitate the establishment and strengthening of participatory mechanisms, including access to justice and community-based action planning, which will ensure that all voices are heard in identifying problems and priorities, setting goals, exercising legal rights, determining service standards, mobilizing resources and implementing policies, programmes and projects (Habitat Agenda 1996: par.\",\"Moreover, subnational authorities, and cities in particular, cannot determine how their budgets are spent. The system for allocating charges between levels of the budget system turns local authorities not into partners of the government - who ensure financing and perform important duties - but into clients petitioning for resources.

Reforms to curb or eliminate unfunded mandates are often limited in scope and may erode over time as new cost-shifting mechanisms are employed (OECD, 2010c). While mandates are often legitimate tools of policy and may help curtail harmful forms of inter-jurisdictional competition, address spillovers that go beyond the jurisdiction (externalities) or ensure conformity with national priorities, they can also distort local government spending priorities and put local budgets (and thus service provision and investment) under strain. Closely linked to this is the question of the degree of control that local governments have over their own spending: in many countries, the share of “mandatory spending” based on national legislation is rather high.\",\"However, it is important that public participation does not turn into an obstacle to urban projects. In some cases, citizens who have opposed plans have taken the case to court to block infrastructure projects. This indicates how important it is to get citizens involved in public deliberations from the earliest stages. For that purpose, local communities need to be given a variety of tools and mechanisms to participate in resolutions adopted by the akimats. To engage the broader public, focus groups, media campaigns and an interactive website could be considered.\",\"Such cultural change takes time, and while the central level can establish policies, plans and programmes, central-level institutions have to provide a behavioural example and embody the practice. Meanwhile, the local level must also be an active player in encouraging a transformation to more open and inclusive government. A report undertaken for SUBDERE and the Ministry of Foreign Relations focusing on the status of citizen participation at the sub-national level17 was highly critical of Antofagasta’s approach, characterising it as narrow, paternalistic and traditional, with little recognition of social or community actors in the management of local development, citizens taking a passive role, and CSOs facing capacity challenges. The report also indicated no systematic identification was made of needs or programme design in areas of interest to citizens and civic organisations.\",\"Regional governments select a portfolio of projects (not comprehensive plans) to be financed by the FNDR.12 However, this fund is also available to municipalities that submit project proposals, most of which are oriented to financing basic local infrastructure and services in order to make up for revenue shortfalls. From a municipal perspective, requests for FNDR funds must pass through a complex set of filters that can vary depending on the project’s size. Larger projects, for example, may pass through regional governments, the Ministry of Social Development’s SEREMI, and the Ministry of Finance, while smaller ones may only go through the regional government and one SEREMI (generally that of Social Development).\",\"This helps avoid reaching the final stages of a project that citizens do not support or recognise as their own. Akims and senior public managers should express at the outset commitment to the process and the principles of the purpose and scope of the exercise. One way to start would be by understanding what people value about the city and engaging on these terms. It is recommended that akims and senior officials from different levels of government engage in regular discussions about the process.\",\"Subnational government spending in this field represented more than 85% of total public spending in 2013 in France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. In some sectors (e.g. waste, sewerage, parks and green spaces), this competence is almost fully devolved to local governments or dedicated functional bodies (e.g. water boards in the Netherlands). It is also often outsourced to agencies, external entities or private providers through public-private partnership contracts (e.g. in France).\",\"Only French local authorities with tax raising powers can join the Agency, this includes cities, inter-municipal entities with tax autonomy, departements and regions. The AFL is modelled on similar institutions that have long operated in Northern Europe without default (the oldest among these, Kommune Kredit, was first established in 1899). This model is gaining traction across OECD countries and has recently been adopted in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Approximately 70% of French local authorities’ investment expenditure is self-financed and their debt amounts to 8% of GDP.\",\"On the other hand, many countries have run into difficulties over sub-national government debt, arousing justified concern that cities and other subordinate governments may operate under soft budget constraints if they are perceived to enjoy implicit or explicit sovereign guarantees. The main challenge, therefore, is to create mechanisms that ensure economic stability and sound fiscal management. Meanwhile, the lower levels of government must be granted sufficient flexibility to cope with unforeseen events, as well as sufficient financial capacity to deliver public services and finance essential investment (Vammalle and Hulbert, 2013).\",\"This, indeed, is one of the main justifications for the imposition of different forms of mandate by higher-level governments. Local authorities are likely to underspend on services or investments that generate benefits for the wider region (positive spillovers) and may be too ready to pursue development or other investment choices that generate negative externalities for their neighbours. Collaboration in such circumstances is one of the major reasons why public investment, in particular, may require a multi-level approach, with a degree of leadership from more senior levels of government (OECD, 2013c).\",\"Pre-eminent government departments (e.g. interior, economics and finance) often fail to appreciate that the ministries of energy, education, health, transport, or public works have major impacts on urban areas. Expertise in this sense requires a broad-ranging institutional view on the way the public sector as a whole affects urban processes, well beyond housing and basic services, to the framing of the economy and society. This implies that, to start with, a national authority must have the capacity to take stock of all of these impacts at the urban level as well as the authority to play a coordinating function across ministries.\",\"Further, some documents cannot be approved without a public inquiry'. This is case for the SCoT, PLU\\u002fPLUI and SRADDET. Alternatively, a land use authority can also decide to organise more open and participatory forms of engagement to obtain some of the inhabitants and users’ opinions through such practices as citizen conferences, focus groups, opinion polls, public meetings and information leaflets. This latter path has the potential to achieve a consensus among a full set of stakeholders, but it is much harder to organise, and there is always the possibility that no mutually agreeable resolution will emerge.\",\"It analyses the administrative and institutional fragmentation affecting urban governance and explores institutionally based governance models, including those for metropolitan areas. Finally, it examines mechanisms to reinforce strategic planning and public service delivery capacity based on the country’s own context and international experience. The government may wish to consider promoting obligatory, city-wide multi-purpose (i.e. not limited to only one activity) joint authorities.\",\"There are benefits to this model, particularly in terms of equity of service provision, and local accountability for the quality and efficiency of service delivery. However, this model also has disadvantages, particularly nationally designed rules that may not be suited to sparsely populated areas, and a lack of incentives for cooperation between municipalities at a functional scale. Formerly used as a coordination mechanism, it has been replaced with the Forum for Sustainable Regional Growth and Attractiveness. This forum is used to promote coordination between levels of government and type of government actor (political and civil service), bringing together representatives from ministries and regional bodies.\",\"Roads are built only up to the geographic limits of the city or city administration. Legal obstacles, for instance the Budget Code, prevent the use of budgets for investment projects across cities or even regions. Under the current rules, each territory requires an administrator, but two administrators are not permitted to manage a project, so the project must be conducted under the auspices of the central government. No flexibility is granted to tailor the governance arrangements to the local area, and local co-operation is lacking. Akims have no incentives to work together, and since they are appointed and assessed by akims at the upper level, their relationships appear to be more competitive than co-operative. It is true that vertical co-ordination is mostly guaranteed through the way vertical relations work across levels of government.\",\"The analysis of the distribution of public spending across the various policy categories presented here can provide an understanding of the policy mix effectively put into place by OECD countries. Unfortunately this is very difficult because spending information on individual instruments is often missing, and the set of instruments for which information is missing changes from country to country. Even for these countries more work is needed to validate the comparability of data.\",\"Decentralisation needs to be a flexible process, allowing the central\\u002flocal dynamics to evolve and taking into consideration the potential instability of the political framework (Work, 2002). There should be a clear design for its implementation, with defined roles for the various management levels and linkages between them. A situation where local players do not have the authority to take decisions cannot lead to good governance.\",\"What mechanisms exist for co-ordinating activities of multiple national ministries operating at the urban level? Which national policies encourage co-operation\\u002fnetworking among cities and reduce the incentives for them to engage in unproductive forms of competition? Are there any national policy barriers to inter-municipal co-ordination?\",\"This is an OECD instalment adopted by the Council. Recommendations are not legally binding, but practice accords them great moral force as representing the political will of member countries. Variations across countries are important, as subnational public investment ranges from 31% in Greece to 91% in Canada. More effective public investment has a critical role to play to address inequalities, rebuild trast, restore growth and enhance well-being. The impact of public investment depends to a significant extent on how governments manage this shared competence across levels of government.\",\"In other countries, subnational governments are in charge of paying the salaries of administrative and technical staff and teachers. Health-related responsibilities fall most often under the responsibility of central government or social security bodies and subnational governments have no role, or a limited one. At the same time, there is considerable variety across OECD countries (e.g. the subnational government share exceeds 60% in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the Nordic countries).\",\"Firstly, the studies encountered three main types of donors (apart from private sector investors) including (i) traditional DAC donors (ii) multilateral financial institutions (e.g. World Bank, Asian Development Bank) and (iii) other state donors. Many of these have very different and conflicting modes of operating, different and sometimes conflicting mandates, and in some cases competition for 'the best' programmes of the national country strategy. In many cases, and despite best efforts, DAC donors and other donors often limit their interactions to information sharing.\",\"In the United States, the New Markets Tax Credit is “a non-refundable tax credit intended to encourage private capital investment in eligible, impoverished, low-income communities” (Marples, 2012). Invitations for public participation in policymaking seem to be more widespread than ever, particularly in cities - with traditional town hall meetings but also city' governments’ increasing use of social media and crowdsourcing opportunities, on topics ranging from climate change to urban planning. Such tools for bottom-up engagement may contribute to the emergence of a new participation economy in cities, especially to remedy some sort of democratic deficit in large cities where the distance between policy makers and citizens may erode trust in institutions.\",\"By law, local authorities must balance their budgets (i.e. they cannot run a budget deficit). The amount of operating incomes must be higher than the amount of operating expenditures and by law, local authorities must balance their budgets (i.e. they cannot run a budget deficit). Local authorities can only borrow funds in order to finance their investments—this is known as the “golden rule” (Box 1.8). In 2013, borrowing by local authorities in France amounted to 7.3% of total revenues (at EUR 229.6 bln) (Government of France, 2016).\",\"The city government organises workshops and training sessions in each district to empower civil society engagement in public administration. Every year, the city government publishes the list of projects that have been designed based on the recommendations of the citizen budget committee. In the budget year 2016, 809 projects were conceived with the ideas of the committee. Although consensus-building through public discussions may often be time-consuming, the city government is strongly committed to the idea that participatory governance unlocks opportunities for open discussions on potentially conflicting ideas and can help improve service delivery, social equity and mutual trust in society (SRI, 2016).\",\"For example, output-based financing has shown positive results. But overall, whether private or public, the available financing or refinancing options for solid waste management remains minimal, necessitating the need to choose those financing models that are most likely to secure revenue and investment capital while delivering reliable services. Such financing models should integrate mechanisms that support good governance, accountability, and reporting and monitoring that matches the global standards and indicators.\",\"It encourages the coordination of national and local actions by jointly working together towards a common national agenda. The whole process from the selection of the local development projects to their implementation is meant to be based on a participatory approach that builds on heated, open and informed debate between different levels of government. Their function is to support municipalities in their association process, thus providing essential services at lower management costs. This national level team tends to be a pro-active force that takes part in all the stages of the strategy building on the field.\",\"This performance information could be used to improve programmes or redefine minimum standards in service delivery. Central government authorities may wish to link the monitoring of performance closely to the attribution of grants, as part of the budget cycle. The experience of OECD countries suggests that linking this closely is often necessary' to make sure that funds are used as intended and that central government authorities can be made to account for the results obtained.\",\"The clause is also subject to some additional rules, such as the principle of neutrality for labour disputes. The clause was first established for communes through the municipal law of 1884 and later extended to other subnational governments in 1982. It has been critiqued as leading to competition between subnational governments and to duplication across responsibilities in some cases (Balladur Committee, 2009). The counter argument to this point is generally that subnational governments have a Constitutional right to “free administration” and that any negation of the clause would undermine that right.\",\"But inevitably, benefit-cost ratios do tend to influence decisions on the allocation of funds across sectors and between dissimilar projects. This strategy puts an emphasis on improving connections: between people and employment, people and services, and business and economies (Cooper and Penrose, 2018). Scheme promoters are expected to develop five cases: financial, commercial, management and - most importantly, strategic and economic.\",\"An objective of future surveys could therefore be to put greater emphasis on seeking input regarding issues that are not raised in the survey, e.g. by inviting respondents to identify unaddressed issues, suggest research topics and propose solutions. Finally, we note that the survey can be an important source of insight regarding the potential gap that may exist between expert beliefs regarding the most effective measures and the existing evidence regarding these measures. Identifying any such gaps could shed light on the need to generate more evidence in certain areas, or alternatively, to better disseminate existing evidence.\",\"Step 97 of the “100 Concrete Steps to Implement the Five Institutional Reforms” reflects central government’s acknowledgement of the need to enhance citizen participation in the decision-making process through the development of self-regulation and local self-government. However, little evidence emerged on how this was being implemented. When a city general plan is developed, a public hearing is held to allow citizens to participate in discussions and air their comments. Cities have the duty to inform residents about the general plans and get feedback from them. This is important, as these experiences can be the foundation for civic action in major cities. The problem seems to be that there is, to some extent, a lack of interest from citizens, due to the mistrust of government in general, no methodology makes public participation an integral part of the urban planning process and implementation, citizens do not perceive a benefit from taking part in these exercises, and local government officials are not trained to engage with the community.\",\"On the participatory side, municipalities were given the right to establish councils of stakeholders or municipal boards. Municipalities can also establish other institutional means of participation through the passing of local constitutions or \\\"organic laws.\\\" One of the most widely reported local approaches to this challenge in Brazil is the participatory budget. The essential element of this institution is the democratic discussion and allocation of the investment budget of the city.\",\"This is because the issues addressed are simply so important for nations and cities that the solutions cannot be left for international organizations to identify. Adoption and implementation is, above all, a local political process requiring local political agreement and engagement. This is not an exercise in scientific discovery of a new disease or a new remedy.\",\"At the same time, citizen engagement requires governments to share in agenda setting and to ensure that policy proposals are collaboratively generated and citizens’ needs are taken into account in making decisions. Citizen engagement is best incorporated into every stage of the policy development and implementation process (OECD, 2010b). The OECD’s “Guiding Principles” for successful citizen engagement in policy making include: commitment, rights, clarity, time, objectivity, resources, co-ordination, accountability, evaluation and active citizenship (OECD, 2001).\",\"Contracts are a tool often used by government to set a framework for long-term projects. They can be broadly defined as an arrangement that reorganises the rights and duties of governments, define mutual obligations, and agree on authority and enforcement mechanisms (formal or informal). There is indeed a trade-off between long-term programmes for economic development which provide certainty for the public and private sector, and the need to adapt to new priorities.\",\"With the law on grassroots democracy in 2002, the CNDP became an independent administrative authority. The law entrusts the Commission with the mission to ensure the participation of the public in the development of major projects of national interest that have strong socio-economic impacts and\\u002for significant impact on the environment or land. Dining this time 16 public meetings were held with 7 420 participants, 405 contributions to the discussion were made by e-mail and, 1 860 written interventions were made (questions, comments, positions).\",\"Fiscal consolidation, including current expenditure prioritisation and public sector wage bill containment, should complement revenue mobilisation measures to improve fiscal and current account balances. Efforts to improve the quality and relevance of education must be stepped up and anti-corruption efforts redoubled to recapture public confidence and strengthen the country’s strong governance record. Growing at 4.5% per year, the urban population as a share of total population increased from 28% in 1991 to 43% in 2011.\",\"Mitigating the possibility of capture requires broad general stakeholder agreement about any comprehensive plan. This includes key government stakeholders at the central, regional and local level, in order to minimise the possibility of obstacles during the approval process, as well as to build a sense of “ownership” by local, external stakeholders (e.g. civil society, citizens and the private sector) to ensure local support for implementation. Such local-level support can also put pressure on elected officials to move ahead with the process, not block plans, and push for speedier approval, further easing implementation.\",\"Guided by the state committees, these offices ensure the organisation’s on-the-ground presence in New Jersey, Connecticut and on Long Island, and play a critical role in the research, planning and advocacy for projects in their respective areas. The majority of the association’s income (81%) comes from its endowment, which is regularly increased by donations from members (individual and corporate). The rest is provided by grants from corporations and philanthropic entities (6%), paid events like seminars and congresses (2%) and funding campaigns (1%). This funding scheme allows the association a high degree of independence in the advice it provides to decision makers. The management of the association consumes 10% of the budget, public affairs 6% and fundraising 4%.\",\"The Constitution (72nd Amendment) Act, 1992, prescribes two new institutions to regulate the flow of funding to municipalities. One new institution is the Central Finance Commission, which both suggests new taxation and financial policies that the states can apply to the municipalities under their sway, but under the new arrangements since 1992, the Governor of a state is required set up a finance commission to review the local system, to propose new taxes, and to govern grants in aid to municipalities from the consolidated funds of the state.37 in spite of these constitutional requirements, results have been limited. With only 1.1 percent of GDP, municipal expenditures in India compare very unfavourably with OECD countries, but even with other BRICS countries such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa.\",\"Thus, it provides assistance in the preparation of public decisions of elected officials, its implementation, its monitoring and Evaluation. It may give themselves records or any matter it deems necessary. It occupies a prominent place for the dissemination of information within the professional circles and associations, or even to the entire population and receives experts as needs.\",\"According to Charbit and Romano (2017[i7j), the CPERs fall under the category of “empowerment contracts”. Empowerment contracts are tools for transferring responsibilities to subnational governments while gradually building capacities for policy implementation. It is also the intention of these types of contracts that sub-national authorities acquire in the middle-long run the necessary capacities to develop their own strategies and co-ordinate with lower levels of government (e.g. municipalities) or private actors. Central governments can include incentives as conditions for signing the contracts, such as partnering with private actors, involving neighbour local governments or adopting specific regulations, among others.\",\"Next, debt should be exclusively used to finance capital projects with a long life, and not to cover budget gaps for current expenditure. The third critical aspect would be to impose a hard budget constraint on borrowers, to eliminate the possibility of a costly bailout by higher levels of government. A central-govemment-mandated borrowing framework would need clear rules about who can borrow, how much, for what purpose, from whom, with what instruments and with what restrictions.\",\"In 2015, a new Ethics Code was introduced to deal with conflicts of interest. This set up a new position, the “ethics commissioner”, for civil servants to consult on ethical issues.19 The National Bureau of Anti-Corruption was established in the Ministry of the Civil Service with the functions of prevention, detection, suppression and investigation of corruption offences. Janenova (2016) points out the need for a cultural change in government and of a renewal of ethical and moral values of civil servants, to be able to create a professional civil service.\",\"Nonetheless, the planning of a city or region needs to engage with organisations above neighbourhood level. For instance, collection and disposal of solid waste and sewage in Almaty, Astana and Shymkent can lead to large-scale environmental and social problems that require civil participation as well as state action. Special strategies for targeting groups that are hard to reach (the disabled, youth and the elderly) would be implemented to ensure their participation in public events and forums.\",\"This requires that they set objectives, create reporting mechanisms and fiscal rules, audit and monitor cities’ finances, and eventually, take corrective measures if necessary. The design of such systems is likely to vary a great deal from country to country as a result of the enormous differences in fiscal systems, municipal competences and constitutional architecture. Since states\\u002fprovinces\\u002fregions are usually responsible for setting fiscal rules and monitoring local governments’ finances in federal and quasi-federal countries, there can even be differences within them.\",\"Interviews suggest that the problematic feature of the methodology is the coefficient used to determine the amount of money withdrawn from “donors” to the national budget. Moreover, OECD (2017, forthcoming) has noted that this mechanism does not take into account a region’s actions or particularities, and acts as a disincentive for using resources efficiently. In addition, the lack of clarity may leave room for mismanagement.\",\"However, spending indicators should be interpreted with caution, as they tend to overestimate the level of decentralisation (OECD, 2016b). Subnational governments, for example, may be responsible for a certain economic function but not have full autonomy in exercising it. These are all federal countries, where states have a high level of autonomy in educational matters, including vocational teaching and higher education (universities).\",\"Categorical grants are very' diverse and are aimed at helping local governments to provide services that are otherwise too costly, finance delegated tasks and policy projects, provide financial assistance and compensation, etc. Other revenues include user charges and fees (8% of revenue) and revenue from property (sales of assets, leasing, dividends, etc.).

The key driver for air pollution in cities is on-road transportation, which continues to be a primary mode of urban transport34 in Chile. National air-quality regulations were updated for a number of air pollutants (PM2.s S02, NO, HC and CO), and a “Clean Air Programme” was launched in 2010, aiming to improve air quality in the biggest cities through sectoral emission reduction strategies (e.g. firewood, industries, transport and monitoring).\",\"While compact cities can foster traffic congestion and higher levels of air pollution, compact urban development can limit travel distances, reduce car dependence and facilitate the development of public transport systems. There are also other, nontransport benefits, such as the preservation of countryside and reduced material and energy use (OECD, 2012, Chen, Jia and Lau, 2008). Increased urban density is associated with reduced transportation C02 emissions per capita, and successful compact cities develop effective internal and external transportation linkages, mixed land use, and high-quality urban services (OECD, 2011).\",\"In urban areas in Emerging Asia, fine particulate air pollution in excess of WHO guideline level is estimated to cause an additional 1.5 million premature deaths per year (Table 3.2). Most of these deaths occur in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter China) (767 772) and India (614 522), due to their large urban populations and high levels of exposure to air pollution. The welfare costs associated with this increased mortality totalled USD 1.28 trillion in 2015 dollars.\",\"Guidelines to develop and evaluate such models are discussed in the FAIRMODE initiative (http:\\u002f\\u002ffairmode.jrc.ec.europa.eu\\u002f) led by the JRC to support use of modelling in the implementation of the EU directives. What can be done in a city depends as said on the sources, but also resources of the city. Possibilities also depend on whether there is willingness at the political level to not only reduce emission via technological improvements but also by decreasing activity rates or implementing structural and societal changes.\",\"Exchange rate: OECD (2015a), \\\"PPPs and exchange rates”, OECD National Accounts Statistics (database), http:\\u002f\\u002fdx.doi.org\\u002f10.1787\\u002fdata-00004-en (accessed 30 June 2015), Minimum wage: CONASAMI (2015), “Tabla de salarios minimos generales y profesionales por areas geograficas”, Comision Nacional de los Salarios Minimos, www.conasami.gob.nix\\u002ft sal mini prof.html (accessed 7 April 2015). This represents a high cost to public health, and has a negative effect on the productivity, competitiveness and attractiveness of the metropolitan zone. The OECD’s work on cities and climate change has observed that if their current pollution trends continue, even cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Osaka, Paris, Seoul and Tokyo are at risk of losing economic attractiveness (OECD, 2010). In the international scene, Mexico is committed to reducing 30% carbon emissions by 2020 and by 40% by 2030 (a combined effect of reducing CO2 emissions by 70% and greenhouse gas emissions by 36%) compared to the emission level in 2012.\",\"In addition, air emissions can be more easily happed by dense urban construction and thereby lead to higher pollution concentrations (Gaigne et al., The environmental Kuznets’ curve (EKC), which gained recognition during the 1990s, is at the heart of this debate. Selden and Song (1994) were the first to study the environmental Kuznets’ curve empirically.\",\"Given its tourism-oriented economy, the city has also set up a mobile app, which informs both tourists and locals of what to do in Phuket. To illustrate this trend, outdoor concentrations of fine particulate matter (PMJS), which is hazardous to health, is commonly used as a proxy measure of pollution. Practically all urban residents in the region are exposed to ambient air pollution exceeding the WHO guidelines on the concentration of fine particulate ambient air pollution (i.e., 10 PM2.5 pg\\u002fm3). Only 0.2% of urban residents in Emerging Asia live in areas with pollution concentrations at or below this level (Figure 2).\",\"One of the Conventions' strengths is the vast and committed scientific community supporting policy-making. This should remain to be at the core of the Convention and should also be the core when it comes to a focus on cities. As discussed above, air quality in cities is very much dependent on air pollution originating from regional and (inter)national sources, but cities also contribute highly to air pollution outside the cities.\",\"Moreover, a 1% increase in the share of agriculture in value added is associated with an increase of 0.11% in SO2 concentration. In contrast to other pollutants, the degree of fragmentation of an urban area does not appear to affect SO2 concentration. This might be due to the fact that SO2 is mainly produced by energy generation processes rather than by road transportation. In particular, this study presents evidence that urban fragmentation is correlated with higher concentrations of NO2 and PM10, when controlling for economic factors and climate conditions. Moreover, the results suggest that densely populated urban areas are associated with higher SO2 concentrations.\",\"N02 concentrations are in general caused by local emissions and thus easier to control by local authorities. Such a source-based approach will also give a quick insight in the options that profit from co-benefits with other policy areas, such as climate\\u002fenergy, noise, health and traffic\\u002furban planning. Two key measures are reducing local coal and biomass burning to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases, and reducing congestion to improve mobility, improve air quality and reduce noise.\",\"Consequently, no statistics are available on the contribution of major sources by sector to the city’s air pollution. Even though the implementation of the automated environmental monitoring system for major emission units was mandated in the Environmental Protection Regulation and Decree No. The city will need to work with the Department of Industry and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment to make a roadmap and allocate sufficient resources to systematically install real-time monitoring stations (air and water) at major IZs, ICs and the port, to identify and measure major pollutants and make the information accessible to public.\",\"The dependent variable, Poll, denotes the level of pollution concentration (see Section 3 for details), Fragments is the variable of interest. Sources is a vector of variables controlling for the sources of the pollutant, it may comprise variables relative to: population, transportation, manufacturing and agriculture (cf. Moreover, model (1) includes land cover controls (LandCover) which are of interest to test and geo-meteorological variables (GeoMeteo) which may impact the level concentration (Elminir, 2005, Kerrie et al.,\",\"In addition, air pollution monitoring per se is not clearly mentioned in MOT’s mandate, the mandate only includes establishing vehicle standards and energy efficiency labels. This also creates some confusion about which actual policies can be decided by MOT. Department of Transport (DOT) under MOT is not in charge of urban transport.\",\"Further complicating is the fact that there is also overlap in health effects between PM2.5 and N02. It is not clear to what extent health effects are different when people are exposed to a combination or cocktail of different pollutants. In real life, exposure to such a cocktail is the most likely situation. Important to note is that there is no doubt that PM2.5 has significant negative impacts on health and should be kept as a representative tracer of such effects.\",\"The same trend was reported in Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Korea and New Zealand for the same period, but 20 other OECD countries achieved a reduction in air pollution-related deaths (OECD, 2014). Information provided by the Ministry of Environment of the Federal District (SEDEMA). It included restricting the circulation of private cars on certain days, depending on registration plate.\",\"At the same time, no socio-economic category is immune from negative environmental conditions. For example, even the highest-end housing units can be regularly exposed to high levels of air pollution since they tend to be located on high traffic axes or have easy access to transport flows, as it is the case in Rome (Cesaroni et al., Generally speaking, according to the International Energy Agency, the European Commission estimated the cost of environmental pollution, taking into consideration health costs alone, to vary between EUR 440 and EUR 1 250 billion (European Commission, 2013). In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that complying w'ith existing standards would cost USD 65 billion, but would bring potential economic revenue of USD 2 trillion (US EPA, 2011).\",\"This update focuses on smart cities, discussing in particular challenges for smart city strategies and addressing environmental risks in Emerging Asian cities in light of rising urbanisation, increasing economic activity and climate change. High levels of air pollution have serious health consequences, especially among lower-income households, and can curtail economic growth prospects. Policy makers in the region would need to strengthen the enforcement of existing rules and work towards clearer and targeted policy frameworks with the participation of all levels of government. Co-operation between countries in the region is just as crucial since environmental hazards are often transborder issues.\",\"As an example, Davis (2008) empirically studies the effect of a driving restrictions program on air quality in Mexico City. In the urban economics literature, the impact of urbanisation on air quality has been studied through different urban structure indicators. One can distinguish between two categories of such indicators: (i) indicators related to the internal composition of the urban area and (ii) urban area morphology indicators.2 Urban area morphology refers to the spatial disposition of the urban tissue (e.g. dispersed urban plots, linearity of urban areas) while internal composition refers to tissue composition (e.g. wetland, green spaces).\",\"Around 64% of water and sanitation networks need complete repair or replacement. Insufficient metering, which does not charge for actual consumption, and low tariffs discourage utility companies from making the substantial investments required to renew and modernise the networks. The two main sources of air pollution are industrial and energy plants and individual motor vehicles. Although concentrations of particulate matter were lower in 2011 than in other upper-middle income countries, they are expected to rise quickly in large cities, given the rapidly increasing motorisation rates.\",\"Projects aimed at reducing travel distances and thus increasing residential and employment density, accompanied by adequate mobility planning and transit supply, can be effective in decreasing the demand for transport as well as stimulating modal split toward less polluting modes. A number of empirical (mainly economic) studies confirm the positive effect of denser urban form on reducing travel distance per capita (e.g., Boamet and Sarmiento, 1999, Bento et al., As mentioned in the first section, building-related energy use accounts for approximately 24% of overall domestic energy demand, taking into account the building’s life cycle (construction, operation and demolition).\",\"As urban areas become denser and rely more on public transport, walking and cycling, carbon emissions tend to decrease. The urban form of cities is not the only determinant of lower per capita emissions, but it is a critical factor among others, such as energy prices, the productive structure of urban areas or the public transport networks (OECD, 2011a). Figure 2.2 shows that when population density in built-up areas is high, motor vehicle ownership tends to be lower. Urban density is calculated based on the OECD definition of “predominantly urban” areas.\",\"Figure 1 illustrates different patterns of urban areas. The ongoing debate on the environmental benefits of compact urban areas partly originates from the fact that the notion of compactness covers various dimensions. Findings and conclusions may well vary with the studied urban structure indicator, air pollutant, and measure of pollution (i.e. concentration or emission levels). In addition to environmental improvements, continuous urban areas may induce benefits such as energy savings, lower costs of maintenance for energy and transport systems, improvement of quality of life through local services and jobs, and more efficient infrastructure investments (OECD, 2012a). In this respect, a compact urban area, given its proximate development, is expected to produce lower emissions of transport-related pollutants compared to a fragmented urban area (e.g. Urban area 2 and Urban area 4).\",\"Citizen science should be promoted and used to raise awareness. It is important to stress though that the quality of the data from those low cost sensors is in general far from sufficient to be used for drawing conclusion on the actual air quality situation and form basis for control measures. This links to the need for harmonization of practices for local measures, such as retrofit approaches and low emission zones. It is recommended to the parties to review and share their success story in the cities. It is not only a problem of scale but also of balance between sectors and other policies. Therefore local actions need to be city specific.\",\"Then, a Bayesian Model Averaging method is employed to select the empirical model which best identifies the determinants of the concentration of different pollutants. For each pollutant, the influence of economic sector composition, population density and factors related to internal urban composition and road transport are tested. The study does not consider factors of pollution that occur outside urban areas, such as inter-city transport or activities in rural areas.\",\"In this light, the scientific bodies under the Convention could focus also on the city scale and assess the contribution of long range transport to air pollution in cities. The scientific community can generate knowledge and methodologies to be used by local authorities, but also regional and national authorities to support their cities. Linkages between both scales should be considered in the tools developed and promoted by the scientific community.\",\"Continuous urban areas enhance connectivity, reduce travel needs and car dependency, and facilitate the use of non-motorised transport modes, such as biking and walking. In addition to environmental improvements, continuous urban areas may induce energy savings, reduce maintenance costs for energy and transport systems, improve the quality of life through local services and jobs and allow efficient infrastructure investments (OECD, 2012). Overall, the findings of the study suggest that instruments aiming at increasing continuity and reducing population density are worth considering in the policy mix used to avoid further air quality degradation by the expansion of urban areas in Europe.\",\"For instance, Figure 4.3 shows that road transport contributes to more than 80% of C02 emitted by the sector in the region while Figure 4.4 illustrates how many kilometres can be travelled for every one ton of C02 emitted by a passenger using different modes. To support policy makers in selecting the most effective measures to reduce C02 emissions in the inland transport sector, different initiatives are ongoing notably one that is implemented by the UN regional commissions as described in Box 4.1. As part of the project, a global status report on inland transport C02 emissions was prepared and the development of an inland transport (road, rail and inland waterways) emission measurement model called For Future Inland Transport Systems (ForFITS) is now complete.\",\"Still, the pollution of surface water and groundwater that comes with industrial wastewater discharge remains a problem. Air quality remains satisfactory in cities with heavy industries and high traffic concentration (i.e. Minsk, Mogilev, Novopolotsk and Soligorsk), although there are problem areas within these cities. More than half of the major cities monitored in the period 2005-2013 have reduced emissions from stationary sources, while Zhlobin city (Gomel Oblast) and Novopolotsk (Vitebsk Oblast) have remained the major contributors of pollutants from stationary sources.\",\"Over the last two decades, thanks to the implementation of four consecutive comprehensive programmes called ProAire (Box 4.1) there has been a dramatic reduction in local air pollution (Figure 4.5). Since 2003, the levels of SO2 and CO have not been above the limit established by the Mexican Official Norm (NOM) of 0.130 ppm average per 24 hours and 11 ppm average per 8 hours respectively. The levels of lead (Pb) have been below the accepted limits since the component was removed from fuels in 1997.\",\"First, causal interpretations of the identified relationships may be invalid, as the effect of time-invariant city characteristics is not controlled for. Second, the analysis cannot shed light on whether the identified relationships change over time. Even though changes in urban structure are relatively slow, changes in air pollution and the relative contribution of different sources in total emissions (e.g. road transport, manufacturing, electricity generation) may be more rapidly evolving over time.\",\"There are also regional efforts to monitor air quality. The ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), for example, was established in 1993 to enhance the capacities of meteorological services. It is also responsible for monitoring and assessing land and forest fires and haze in the region, as well as providing real-time air quality information from multiple stations in the region. Some countries in the region have national air quality standards covering at least some of the six main outdoor air pollutants: fine (PM25) and coarse (PM10) particulate matter, ozone (03), nitrogen dioxide (N02), and sulphur dioxide (SO,) (Table 3.3).\",\"Seawater quality improved after the Dokai Bay clean-up in 1972 and implementation of industrial wastewater regulation. Current measures include i) chemical substance monitoring (S02, N02, CO, SPM, NO*, PM2 5, dioxins, benzene and trichloroethylene) at 14 general ambient air-monitoring stations and 5 automobile exhaust gas monitoring stations, and ii) water quality monitoring at environmental reference points (27 river sites, 7 ocean sites and 1 lake site) and general measurement points (5 river sites, 11 ocean sites). National standards limit the legal amount of air pollution and wastewater discharges from industries and businesses in Kitakyushu, and the city has the power to control the implementation of these standards.\",\"Concentrations of population and economic activity in urban areas are additional complicating factors. Among the important issues facing cities, this chapter discusses the challenges related to air pollution and how to respond to them through smart city policies. Air pollution can damage human capital and create other non-health costs.\",\"Some evaluations are already providing useful feedback. The evaluation of the ProAire programme suggests that air-quality standards could be more stringent, to reap additional health benefits, and notes the need to strengthen compliance with particular standards. Some municipalities do not even have the technical capacity to follow up and assess results, given the lack of skilled staff and financial means.\",\"The relationship between population density and the concentration of specific air pollutants is also analysed. Due to these differences in emission sources, urban areas do not face the same patterns of concentration of different air pollutants. The choice of the appropriate empirical specifications is hereby guided by a state-of-the-art econometric model selection method (Bayesian Model Averaging - BMA).\",\"The papers are generally available only in their original language -English or French- with a summary in the other language. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. Using a unique dataset of 249 Large Urban Zones (LUZ) across Europe, a Bayesian Model Averaging selection method is employed to empirically identify the determinants of within-LUZ concentration of three air pollutants: NCL, PMi0 and SO2 for the year 2006. Several indices of land use are considered among possible determinants.\",\"In order to be successful, it is crucial that there is public awareness about the need to take measures as well as acceptance of the measures by society. Assessment of actual health effects also requires consideration of actual exposure, using exposure indicators next to assessment of air quality limit values. It is then up to the authorities to assess the actual situation to choose forthe measures that fits best to the local situation.\",\"These are supplemented by a dataset on various economic, demographic and meteorological variables that can explain the variation of air pollution. The results of this econometric analysis support the hypothesis that urban structure has significant effects on pollution concentration. In particular, they suggest that fragmented urban areas experience higher concentrations of NO2 and PMI0 and that densely populated urban areas suffer from higher SO2 concentration.\",\"Estimates show that in 2015, the death rate due to air pollution was highest in landlocked developing countries (LLDC) followed by least developed countries (LDCs), and lowest in developed regions (see figure 20). The campaign involves partners such as - WHO, UNER World Bank, UN-Habitat and several countries. Most high-income untries have well-developed air quality onitoring and reporting networks at le ground level, which generally provide nsistent hourly readings of air quality. On the other hand, many low- and middle-income countries lack sufficient data coverage for all their human settlements.\",\"The gap is presumably due, to a great extent, to the lack of accurate deregistration of vehicles that are scrapped or no longer in use, which is reflected in the fact that these vehicles are not enrolled in the inspection and maintenance programme. Nonetheless, the role of the CAMe (like that of other metropolitan commissions) has been limited by the lack of a legal framework with binding mechanisms for ensuring co-operation from state- and municipal-level governments. The metropolitan commission framework is explained in detail in Chapter 5. In the case of the vehicle restriction scheme, Hoy No Circula, considerable controversy about its effects on air quality improvements has arisen.\",\"It is clear though that, in order to solve air quality problems, regional and transboundary policy coordination remains necessary. Local actions are an effective means of improving air quality but these need to be supported by regional and national (sectoral) emission reductions. To tackle this, reduction of NH3 emissions is required, especially in areas where other pollutants are in excess in the atmosphere.\",\"Cities of similar size and similar geographical locations (Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius) can also vary substantively in terms of emission levels (figure 2.41 )v. The main sources of energy generation for electricity and heating purposes may explain these differences. These are mainly the capitals of the EU member States, while the capitals of the countries with economies in transition do face challenges in combatting the high concentration of these two pollutants (figure 2.42.). As for the C03 emissions, the values are also at city level and not for urban transportation only. Therefore, further measures to limit the concentration of particulate matter would need to be applied throughout the sectors where solid and liquid fuels are combusted, in particular in the energy, industry and transport sectors.\",\"However, since green growth policies cannot be separated from related sectoral policies, co-ordination among relevant national ministries is critical to the successful implementation. However, other ministries are also responsible for monitoring air pollution based on the economic activities under their supervision. For example, Ministry of Transportation (MOT) is responsible for monitoring emissions from cars and other transport modes. This has created overlapping mandates.\",\"In spite of these achievements, local authorities acknowledge that additional efforts are needed to reduce the level of pollutants that are still beyond the national standards such as ozone and particulate matter. The measures adopted to improve air quality have been diverse, from closing the most polluting factories to banning cars in the metropolitan area one day per week through the Hoy No Circula programme (“No driving today”). Mexico City’s government has introduced the Atmospheric Monitoring Network (Red de Monitoreo Atmosferico, SIMAT), which provides data for informed policy making and has led to the adoption of the Metropolitan Index of Air Quality, and the establishment of contingency and pre-contingency protocols.\",\"It requires that a monitoring system be established on the state or quality of the physical environment for each “value”. This scheme of monitoring environmental values is derived from EU quality standards.31 The “rules of instruction” refer to any rule relating to the execution of a duty or power by an administrative body. The role of the government within this context is to link the initiatives of various actors who are developing projects that impact the physical environment, and to monitor their outcomes. Where there are undesirable outcomes, the relevant administrative bodies will need to establish a programme to remedy this.\",\"In contrast to PM|0 and NO?, Therefore, denser urban areas may produce higher residential SO? Finally, the results suggest that high-income urban areas experience lower concentrations of PM 10 and SO?. This may result from tighter environmental regulations or higher public expenditure to improve air quality in high income areas.\",\"To support the development of effective and state of the art policies on air quality, a quick update of the WHO air quality guidelines is necessary. The current version stems from 2005 and there is sufficient evidence that a tightening of the values would be justified. It would be recommendableto invest in a thorough study of the actual effects of green in cities and how it can be used in the most efficient way. A first step would be to inform, regional and national authorities, asthere appears to be a big difference in actual knowledge from the government side. It is important to find communication strategies that will reach as many stakeholders as possible. In order to guarantee reliable and harmonized information, there is an important role for international organisations such as the EU, UNECE, WHO and UNEP.\",\"Separate local pollution standards may also be set for particular cities or regions. In 2013, a target of 60 PM2 5 pg\\u002fm3 was set for Beijing by 2017, and was achieved, according to the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau. Motor vehicle engines produce a range of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and hydrocarbons. Particulate matter pollution is also produced by vehicles from non-exhaust sources such as road, brake and tire wear.\",\"This would help in the development of effective public health policy interventions (Box 3.1). An ADB study compared actual and recommended numbers of air quality monitoring stations in Asian cities based on population and pollution level, as implied by an EU directive though terrain and other factors also affect the number of sites needed (ADB, 2014). Generally, cities in developed Asian economies had enough monitoring sites for their population, Singapore, for example, has 15, while 13 are recommended for a city of its size (Table 3.1).\",\"Such modelling tools can be a useful for comparing sustainable transport policies and assisting policy makers to select the most effective measures to reduce C02 emissions in the inland transport sector. Pilot exercises for the model and organization of regional and national capacity building workshops are planned, which will provide opportunities to learn about various emission measurement methods and mitigation policies as well, as to apply model. Over 90 per cent of this air pollution is attributed to vehicle emissions, with older vehicles, poor vehicle maintenance, inadequate infrastructure and low fuel quality exacerbating the situation.\",\"The geographical distance between residential areas and job centres results in long commute times, traffic congestion and damage to public health due to air pollution. Encouraging proximity and connectivity between jobs and homes would help reduce these negative externalities and improve economic competitiveness, while improving the quality of life. Urban development needs to ensure that job centres have sufficient housing nearby, under the city master plan.\",\"The estimated health impact of air pollution in Kazakhstan is sizeable: premature mortality attributed to air pollution was estimated at 16 117 deaths for the 2008-2010 period, with the highest mortality estimate due to air pollution in Almaty City (Kenessariyev et al., This last study also concludes that the impact of air pollution on premature mortality in Kazakhstan is notably higher than in Russia and Ukraine. However, environmental monitoring systems are not sufficiently funded, and environmental statistics do not always reflect the current pollution load on the environment (World Bank, 2016a).\",\"The opposite phenomenon is observable for a number of Polish LUZs. Yet, Madrid experiences high levels of concentration for each type of pollutant as opposed to Estonia which records a low level of pollution. Figures 3, 4 and 5 highlight the importance of understanding the differences across pollutants as some areas are very affected by one pollutant and much less by others. Furthermore, Table 2 below shows that the correlations between pollutants do not exceed 0.5 which is relatively low. Derived from CORINE Land Cover (CLC), UMZ data covers the whole EU-27 at 200-meters resolution for those urban areas that are considered to contribute to urban tissue and function. Geospatial data on land-use for each urban area are obtained by superimposing the LUZ boundaries and the UMZ spatial data, for each LUZ, data collected on urbanisation allow the study of different components of urban form: number of fragments, share of artificial area, share of agricultural area, share of wetland, share of forest area, population density, population decentralisation (with respect to the core city) and the LUZ surface.\",\"If the industrial zone is within the city, DOC and PPC are involved as well. The overlapping of mandates, coupled with the lack of co-ordination has crippled effective implementation. The Decision has assigned each ministry to be responsible for the air quality resulting from the economic activities that they manage, and all ministries to be equally responsible for the implementation of this decision. However, no co-ordination mechanism across ministries such as an appointed focal point has been proposed, which tends to make the implementation more difficult.\",\"Most countries in the region (except for Brunei Darussalam, Lao PDR and Myanmar) have national air quality standards covering at least some of the main outdoor air pollutants. The level of these standards varies across countries in the region, which have very different average levels of exposure to air pollutants. Separate local pollution standards may also be set for particular cities or regions.\",\"Particulate matter measuring less than 2.5 micrograms (pm) in diameter (PM2.5) is a major concern among all air pollutants for human health since they can penetrate the lungs, impacting respiratory health. In 2015, Northern Africa and Western Asia, and Central and Southern Asia, recorded the highest PM2.5 concentrations estimated at 49 and 48 pg\\u002fm3, respectively (Figure 18). The Oceania subregion recorded the lowest concentrations.\",\"Enforcing standards on fuel quality and vehicle emissions can reduce dangerous emissions from motor vehicles. Many countries in the region follow European standards for emissions, which define maximum acceptable emission rates of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide per kilometre travelled.

Sweden has all types of rural areas within its national territory: from those with proximity to functional urban areas, to remote rural areas. The southern part of the country is more densely populated than the north, while the north is characterised by different areas such as a sparsely populated interior with population concentrated in cities along the coast. In remote rural areas, there are places which have very concentrated populations in few centres (such as Norrbotten), and other where the population is more evenly distributed (such as Jamtland-Harjedalen).\",\"The Agency’s classification better reflects the diversity of Sweden’s rural landscape because it captures better the reality of the large size and internal differences within administrative regions and the fact the rural Sweden is characterised by a dispersed population with settlements of various sizes.

Co-ordination on urban extension and infilling could minimise transport and service delivery costs, optimise the use of land, and support the protection and organisation of urban open spaces. Co-ordination on urban upgrading and retrofitting could increase residential and economic densities and promote more socially integrated communities. Engagement between the regions and municipalities in the functional urban area should be a continuous and iterative process, grounded in enforceable regulations that aims to promote a vibrant, more compact Prague and with synergies between territories. However, there needs to be concrete incentives in place to promote these partnerships, particularly when it comes to spatial planning.\",\"The network has organised several conferences, seminars and meetings with key stakeholders. The largest event is the Skane Flousing Forum (Skanskt bostadsforum), which takes place in late autumn every' year since 2014. It brings together about 150 partners of the housing sector, experts and politicians for a discussion of key issues about the housing market.\",\"Most telling is the fact that at the southern end of Western Scandinavia, Skane generally frames its own development as part of the Copenhagen area as illustrated in the creation of the Greater Copenhagen and Skane Committee (see earlier description) and the common branding of Skane under “Greater Copenhagen”. Paradoxically, this is a case where cross-border governance to better control borders may have addressed one policy issue (migration) but aggravated others (labour market, environment). High-speed train (running at 320 km\\u002fhour) was supposed to connect Stockholm with Gothenburg in 2 hours and with Malmo in 2.5 hours by 2035.\",\"Despite the fact that youth in the Million Programme areas live and work in an environment which in many respects is characterised by resignation and alienation, “business” is a widespread subject of conversation and many dream of achieving success through establishing their own business. The YUMP’s long-term objectives are to: 1) empower youth living in the Million Programme areas, 2) build bridges and networks between Swedish industry and the target group, 3) build mutual commercial levers for all parties involved, and 4) create methods and processes which also attract people from outside the Million Programme areas. The pilot project’s short-term objectives are to: 1) identify channels of communication with the target group to capture their interest and create a dialogue about entrepreneurship, 2) verify and develop an attractive process and pedagogy for the target group, and 3) point out to Swedish industry' the entrepreneurial power to be found within the target group and work for their desire to involve themselves.\",\"Thus, direct hierarchical involvement in investment projects is not how vertical co-ordination issues are typically dealt with in Sweden. Instead, the different levels of government together with central government agencies and all other relevant actors engage in continuous dialogue. The OECD Review recommended that it could be fruitful to better link dialogue with the evidence obtained from the indicator system and case-specific impact evaluations, as a means to make a stronger case for co-financing arrangements.\",\"It runs several networks and helps create connections between firms, universities and different regional organisations. Svinesundskommitten also participates in a 2017-20 working group within the Nordic Council of Ministers focusing on innovation and resilience within Nordic border regions. It works specifically on advocating for joint investment in better and more sustainable transport and logistics between Oslo and Gothenburg as a way to make the area more attractive to people and businesses.\",\"The financing is split between the national government (50%), the revenues from the congestion tax (41%), the city of Gothenburg (4%), Region Vastra Gotaland and Region Halland (total 4%), and realised property values (1%). While the decision on the agreement was taken with clear majorities in the political bodies of Gothenburg, Region Vastra Gotaland and Region Halland, there was limited, if any, public discussion. In a local advisory referendum, which took place after the agreement was implemented, a majority of citizens was against the tax, but the tax collection (started in 2013) is still in place. The tax is SEK 9-22 depending on the time of day (the corresponding tax in Stockholm is SEK 11-35 and in Oslo NOK 33). Since the tax was implemented, travel by car has increased in Gothenburg in line with the national average, but travel by public transport has increased faster. The package is now being implemented and most investments are scheduled to be finalised by 2026.\",\"If the planned reform succeeds, the Swedish “hourglass” will change, particularly at the subnational level, as a stronger county level could be a better partner for municipalities in regional development issues. The County Council’s responsibility for regional development became permanent in 2010 and at that time two additional regions received development competences. Six years later, ten more County Councils have the responsibility for regional development (including public transport and culture), on top of public healthcare. The result has been a strongly context-dependent approach to regional governance rather than a “one-size-fits-all” approach.\",\"A promising step towards addressing cross-border transport challenges was finally achieved when the Transport Committee in the Swedish parliament announced that the government should develop a national strategy for cross-border rail traffic to reduce the vulnerability of the transport system (as part of the proposals for the National Plan 2018-2029). The plan is currently submitted for comments and will be decided in the first half of 2018. It should be noted that the national transport plans of Norway and Sweden will then cover the same planning period (2018-29).\",\"For example, a regional referendum in 1996 to merge the city Lander of Berlin with the surrounding Lander of Brandenburg as ‘\\\"Berlin-Brandenburg” failed to reach the necessary majority vote in Brandenburg, while a majority of Berliners voted in favor of the merger (Hauswirth, Herrschel and Newman, 2003). Instead, the main mechanism is some form of voluntary agreement that results in co-ordinated actions (OECD, 2015). These agreements can be complex to negotiate and may be limited, at least initially, to topics where all parties see an immediate benefit.\",\"Second, it discusses opportunities and challenges to make collaboration more effective and fruitful. Third, it offers a set of insights on concrete steps that could help build a stronger, more integrated megaregion. Western Scandinavia brings together the Norwegian capital and the second- and third-largest Swedish cities.\",\"The approach to municipal mergers is a combination of voluntary and forced. Voluntary mergers include some that cut across county boundaries (0stfold\\u002fAkershus and Akershus\\u002fBuskerud). Sweden has established a parliamentary committee in charge of investigating ways to strengthen the capacity of municipalities to meet new societal needs, which is scheduled to submit its proposal by 2019.\",\"The results present several clear opportunities for green growth and call for urgent policy actions. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. This is further exacerbated by land-use plans and zoning ordinances of some LGUs being outdated and needing revision to bridge the gap between what is planned and what is built.\",\"With the 2017 reform, Wien-Umgebung was divided into four parts, each of which was absorbed into a different predominantly rural county (Bruck an der Leitha, Komeuburg, St. Polten Land and Tulin). This stated objective is visible in most of the regional strategic documents currently in place: the Oslo-Akershus Joint Regional Plan for Transport and Land Use, the Vision of Vastra Gotaland and the Regional Development Programme (RUP) of Vastra Gotaland “VG2020”, Skane’s regional development strategy “The Open Skane 2030” and “Strategies for Polycentric Skane” (Table 2.5). In the case of Oslo-Akershus, the national government’s push for a joint regional plan on transport and land use stimulated co-ordination between both counties and municipalities (Box 2.4). In the case of the two Swedish sub-regions, the focus on polycentric development may also reflect the fact that the current perimeter of Vastra Gotaland and Skane is the result of county amalgamations in 1998-99.2 The Committee for Sustainable Development in Vastra Gotaland ensures effective co-ordination and mutual reinforcement between regional and municipal initiatives (Box 2.5).\",\"The OKS was initiated in 2007-13 and renewed in 2014-20 to address themes related to the green economy, innovation, employment and transport (Box 2.10 and Chapter 1). The Sweden-Norway programme focuses on innovative environments, small and medium-sized enterprises, natural and cultural heritage, sustainable transportation, and employment over the 2014-20 period. Within the Sweden-Norway programme, one of the three geographic sub-programmes (Grenselest Samarbeid) covers southern Akershus (Folio), the 0stfold interior and Fyrbodal (14 municipalities in the north-western part of Vastra Gotaland).\",\"This document, as well as any data and map included herein, are without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory, to the delimitation of international frontiers and boundaries and to the name of any territory, city or area.

External comments were received from Lewis Dijkstra of the European Commission and Iven Stead, Department for Transport (DfT), UK.\",\"A future HSR corridor was considered an effective way to relieve the pressure on fast-growing Oslo and to make it possible to commute between Oslo and Gothenburg. Modem rail was also expected to help significantly reduce emissions, compared to air, road and tmck transport. The project generated unprecedented momentum and enthusiasm. It had a significant impact on the HSR debate, especially in Norway.\",\"The Swedish municipal federations are legal entities, whose tasks and obligations are formally agreed upon by their members. These inter-municipal co-operative organisations are usually run by boards, whose members are not directly elected but instead nominated by the member municipalities. Over the years, inter-municipal collaboration among Swedish municipalities has increased steadily: in 2005 there were 80 municipal federations and by 2011 the number of federations increased to 110 (Regeringskansliet, 2005[26]) (OECD, 2017[25]).\",\"A law passed in 2009 reinforced regional responsibilities. Reform in 1999 reduced the number of counties from 24 to 21 (creation of Vastra Gotaland and Skane). Further regional mergers were investigated in 2015-16 but were eventually dropped. Latvia is not included due to tire lack of data availability.\",\"Together with its sister organisation, Business Region Goteborg, Oslo Teknopol IKS defined a project plan, an organisational form and a financing framework. This meant, however, that the German part was no longer eligible for participation. New political leadership in Copenhagen also took power and turned out to be less interested in international co-operation.\",\"For example, the critical mass was estimated to be 3 000 residents in Luxemburg and 5 000-6 000 inhabitants in Estonia (per the recommendations that an administrative reform expert committee put forward in November 2015), but 10 000-20 000 residents in Norway (per the 2014 ad hoc expert committee appointed by the government), and 20 000 residents in Finland during the PARAS reform (only for primary' healthcare and related services - compared with 50 000 residents for vocational education, for example). In the case of Finland, the methodology used to identify an optimal threshold was criticised and the legislation was changed in 2011 to include more diverse criteria. Linguistic and\\u002for cultural particularities may also be taken into account (e.g. in Estonia, Finland, Greece, Iceland, etc.). For example, in the United States, a wide variety of “special districts” (as opposed to general purpose local governments) provide a single public service (or a set of related public services) to the residents of a determined area.\",\"Metropolitan-wide planning raises questions about the appropriate scale to tackle land-use issues, the democratic legitimacy of decisions that take place outside of formal governmental institutions, and the ability to secure stable forms of funding and achieve long-term goals. Experiences from other jurisdictions demonstrate some potential strategies for Prague to pursue. Following this, strategies to manage inter-jurisdictional land-use conflicts are discussed along with the potential of rural-urban partnerships.\",\"As discussed in Chapter 1, while these individual regions are large (in population size) in their national context, they remain relatively small in the international arena - in fact, none of them gets close to the size of the average OECD region. However, when considered altogether, Western Scandinavia is almost twice as large as the typical OECD region - achieving a potential critical mass of more than 4.8 million people, nearly double the 2.3 million OECD average (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1). Regarding the regional level, a government bill was presented to the parliament in April 2017 and put forward a proposal to reduce the number of counties from 19 to 10, plus Oslo.\",\"The European Union’s ITIs in the Czech Republic encourage integrated spatial planning across functional uiban areas. It is important that such investments be based on the good land-use practices that have been described in plans and strategies at the national, regional and local levels, such as developing brownfield sites in advance of greenfield ones, permitting developments only in areas where there is existing infrastructure to support them, and protecting agricultural lands, forested areas and watersheds. Through ITIs, municipalities are required to form collaborative bodies (municipal association agreements) in order to forward projects of metropolitan importance and to access investments.\",\"The agreements must have been concluded with a reservation for subsequent legal actions as well as approval by the government and, where relevant, the parliament. On 4 January 2016, ID checks were introduced for all train, bus and boat passengers traveling from Denmark to Sweden. On the same day, the Danish Prime Minister announced that Denmark would introduce temporary border checks for those travelling from Germany to Denmark. Until then, transport companies were responsible for checking the identity of passengers while they were still on Danish soil. Train passengers were therefore required to change trains at Copenhagen Airport and go through the identity checkpoint. Likewise, HH Ferries had introduced ID checks of all passengers travelling to Helsingborg at the ferry port in Helsingor.\",\"The long travel times involved in the coastal corridor are compounded by the lack of modem and efficient rail infrastructure. In this geography, combined with typical obstacles to cross-border integration, Western Scandinavia currently lacks a clear unifying vision for development. While Western Scandinavia mostly functions around its three large metropolitan areas, signs of grow'ing interlinkages between them underline their potential to work closer together as a megaregion.\",\"Consequently, there is a significant gap in objectives between the urban and rural elements of the metropolitan region. This suggests that a collaborative agreement to jointly manage development in a way that provides benefits to both Prague and the proximate municipalities would be in every party’s interest. Prague’s 2008 update of the Strategic Plan articulates this as a major priority, it recommends forging stronger links between Prague and Central Bohemia through the creation of a permanent working group on transboundary development (Stanilovand Sykora, 2014: 155). Meanwhile, Central Bohemia’s Regional Development Program (2006, updated 2009) articulates similar goals.\",\"A 500 kilometre-long coast, a population of 5 million and an aggregated gross domestic product (GDP) of USD 200 billion may only have a limited impact if no effective governance is in place to help local partners identify a common goal: leverage their combined spending power and implement their action plans together. Conversely, governance alone can do little to empower a territory where there is no compelling economic, social and institutional rationale for collaboration - a political construct on its own is bound to hit its limits soon enough. To accomplish its objective of becoming a strong and attractive megaregion in the global arena, Western Scandinavia needs to work on achieving a clear agreement about its own vision and collectively define the concrete steps to take. First, it maps the institutional landscape in Western Scandinavia.\",\"At present, there is both a high degree of linkage associated with the effects from rapid suburban growth that revolve around weaknesses in road and public transport investment, congestion rising from the increase in commuting, perceptions that suburban residents are using urban public services that they are not paying for, and a shift in tax base from Prague to nearby municipalities. Because Prague is spatially bound, almost any suburban development takes place outside its municipal boundary, which makes the intensity of the effects high. Prague is striving to adopt a green growth urban strategy that is based on a compact city and to encourage urban renewal through redevelopment of browmfield sites. While this is the vision of the city of Prague’s government, it does not appear to be the vision of the surrounding municipalities, nor of the people who have relocated there.\",\"On the other hand, such networks partly overlap with each other and do not always lead to concrete results. Even though the consensus-oriented Nordic (and particularly Swedish) political culture generally minimises disruptive disagreements, the oversupply of co-ordination channels may generate inertia and inaction in Western Scandinavia. If Western Scandinavia wants to effect real change, it needs to define clear policy objectives for co-operation (Box 2.15). Structuring objectives into a hierarchy of higher and lower level objectives is a good way to prioritise them and illustrate how they affect each other.\",\"After the project ended, the DSA has remained but lost much of its initial momentum. Research and innovation 3. Low-carbon economy 6. Environmental protection and resource efficiency 7. The programme has existed since Interreg IV (2007-13). In the period 2007-13, the OKS programme supported about 125 cross-border projects, which brought together around 400 partners from Denmark, Norway and Sweden (mainly universities, regions and large municipalities).\",\"The negotiators and the secretariat held around 100 meetings with municipalities and regions located along the railway’s possible routes and in the metropolitan areas, as well as with representatives of business, stakeholder organisations, and other actors in Sweden and internationally. The Swedish Transport Administration was an important collaborator and produced a great deal of the analyses required. In the second half of 2015, municipalities and regions submitted benefit analyses to the National Negotiation.\",\"The first VisitDenmark campaign with Airbnb took place at the beginning of 2016. It was a co-branding campaign centred on the movie “The Danish Girl”, and performed over benchmark on all parameters. Another initiative was collaboration on an event for Danish Airbnb hosts. The main purpose of the event was to share knowledge about the tourists using the services in the sharing economy among the partners involved (including SnappCar, Cook With a Local, and selected local Danish brands).\",\"Over time, the connection between place of work and place of residence further eroded as people began to change employers with greater frequency. Development and Administration of Prague, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands, Sykora, L., J. Kamenicky and P. Hauptmann (2000), \\\"Changes in the spatial structure of Prague and Brno in the 1990s”, Acta Universitatis Carolinae Geographica, Vol. The planned economy had focused on expanding large machinery manufacturing facilities and other forms of industry and on constructing large residential complexes of relatively small apartments (Sykora, Kamenicky' and Hauptman, 2000, Sykora and Mulicek, 2014).\",\"In this case, Kubler’s (2007) discussion of types of negotiations might suggest that a more limited set of objectives might be desirable. While Prague will be entering into an evolving long-term relationship with the municipalities, it needs a limited framework agreement from Central Bohemia that gives the municipalities in the Prague East and Prague West districts permission to negotiate with Prague without the regional government of Central Bohemia blocking the process. Further, the development principles of both Prague and Central Bohemia should align on strategic spatial objectives.\",\"In the United States, eminent domain is defined as “an exercise of the power of government or quasi-government agencies (such as airport authorities, highway commissions, community development agencies and utility companies) to take private property for public use” (United States Department of Housing and Uitoan Development, 2016). A community land trust is currently being developed in Brussels, Belgium as well as in Voi, Kenya. Other examples of stakeholder engagement in cities include the emergence of workers’ co-operatives. For instance, the Cleveland Evergreen Cooperatives in Ohio (United States) bring together local hospitals and universities in supporting new business creation and aims to chart the way for intra-community development while creating a fairer workplace (Box 5.18).\",\"Prague’s spatial evolution was shaped by its changing economic function, and by its role first as the main city of Bohemia and later as a principal city in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and ultimately as a national capital. Importantly, during most of this period, land markets had played a major role in determining land uses. By the end of World War II, the result was an urban core with a variety of high-value commercial and residential buildings, built in various periods, that provided a high level of cultural and historical amenities, and a surrounding ring of manufacturing establishments and worker housing that reflected the role of the region as a major industrial manufacturing centre. Prague’s role as a manufacturing hub was further enhanced by the introduction of a socialist state that was embedded in the larger economic structure directed by the Soviet Union.\",\"The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.

While innovation, best practice governance and energy were among the major themes envisioned for collaboration, the one that received the most attention was the possibility of building a high-speed rail (HSR) connection between Oslo and Berlin. In 2007, politicians from all participating cities - Berlin, Copenhagen, Malmo, Helsingborg, Gothenburg and Oslo - signed the COINCO Charter, which marked the end of the first Interreg project. The responsibility to continue the process was handed over to the city of Oslo, and further on to the region’s public development agency, Oslo Teknopol IKS.\",\"Guiding these regional development strategies is the National Strategy 2015-2020, which serves as an anchor document for regional growth initiatives originating at the regional and national levels. It provides a framework for investing in regions and rural areas. The national policy goal for regional development is to develop the potential in all parts of the country with stronger local and regional competitiveness. The strategy provides a policy framework for the development of all regions in Sweden and focuses on investing in enabling factors utilising a place-based approach.\",\"However, both sides have a lot to gain from resolving the problems. Prague is unlikely to see significant urban renewal as long as greenfield development opportunities are available just outside its boundaiy. However, small municipalities cannot resolve growing transport problems, nor provide the full set of services to their new residents without co-operation from Prague. This ultimately may be a more difficult task because there is a considerably smaller shared interest between the two regions than between Prague and its nearby municipal neighbors.\",\"It has a weak capacity to speak with one voice and present strong evidence to the two respective national governments, other than claiming that what is good for a given part of its territory is ultimately good for the country. The closest Western Scandinavia has gotten to a form of politically integrated governance body was the “Scandinavian Arena” (DSA), a cross-border political co-operation body, which also initiated the 8 Million City project and served as a steering group for the project (discussed earlier). Although the 8 Million City project allowed for a substantial amount of innovative thinking and data mining, it never managed to put together a full, coherent cost-benefit analysis covering the entire high-speed coastal rail corridor it was advocating for (Chapter 1).\",\"These goals, along with desire to reduce traffic congestion are, however, only partly the purview of Prague. There is a lack of a metropolitan vision and strategy. The rapid and continued growth of hundreds of communities surrounding Prague necessarily impacts the city itself. It has led to a large number of commuters to the urban core daily along with the attendant traffic congestion and air pollution problems, it has placed pressure on Prague’s services and infrastructure, and it has transformed former agricultural and green areas to new residential and commercial\\u002findustrial uses with services and infrastructure not always keeping up adequately to the pace of these new developments. How can Prague better co-ordinate with municipalities across its functional urban area to tackle pressing spatial development challenges?\",\"Funding is provided for projects and activities that align with these regional plans. The government appropriates SEK 1.5 billion annually to support regional growth measures, and is mostly used alongside other funding sources from the region, municipalities, and the European Union. Rural policy in Sweden is defined in a narrow sense at the moment, to a large extent around the parameters of CAP Pillar 2 funding.\",\"At the moment, 8.3% of the total population of Italy are immigrants and most of them are relatively young (40% under 29). Between 2011-2015 the average yearly increase in the inflow of migrants was 4.9% (OECD, 2018(24])- This population should be considered in the development strategies of Inner Areas in order to harness their potential contribution to the local economy. Among OECD members, Sweden consistently ranks in the top in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and it maintains one of the lowest GINI indices of regional disparity in GDP per capita. This strategy is coupled with efforts to build urban-rural linkages that promote greater inter-municipal cooperation in public service delivery, and regional development strategies that prioritise planning based on functional regions.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"9_prague_regional_municipalities\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"9_prague_regional_municipalities\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[-2.772091,-2.8060713,-2.7028227,-2.6652389,-2.8307238,-2.7345893,-1.1945136,-2.8540525,-1.1842383,-1.0543511,-2.8789995,-2.8648756,-2.7537055,-2.2181463,-2.8656094,-2.7452767,-2.557596,-2.8884225,-1.1780989,-2.811238,-2.6272535,-2.666289,-2.7581513,-2.8081489,4.0727425,-2.8894725,-2.5545838,-2.5705845,-2.9051907,-2.5661092,-1.0914947,-2.725948,-0.8746072,-2.9023407,-2.817276,-1.1915723,-2.7498255,-1.1889873,-2.6856337,-2.767165,-2.881103,-2.8749592,-1.2031701,-1.1838864,-0.8340502,-1.1947172,-2.6734624,-2.8951821,-2.5974822,-1.1979294,-2.8497236,-1.1887703,-2.655238,-2.6361074,-2.198043],\"y\":[5.302632,5.3467917,5.3878174,5.417569,5.2275176,5.2149425,7.2540183,5.2382617,7.264391,7.0538416,5.208334,5.2648892,5.1723666,5.0028267,5.25939,5.3450623,5.4569793,5.24971,6.9466367,5.2978487,5.4507275,5.132188,5.3477755,5.2396,4.825652,5.2535424,5.513195,5.4557405,5.237556,5.4321494,7.1264186,5.327658,6.936405,5.247018,5.2922254,7.2574253,5.3278465,7.258125,5.3516836,5.210611,5.25269,5.212585,7.2608776,7.25312,6.872439,7.260507,5.129715,5.2467427,5.42367,7.2674036,5.269852,7.266248,5.390832,5.432848,5.771757],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"Strengthening national and local capacities is therefore paramount to enable and build systems that support collection, analysis and dissemination of SDGs data and information, including supporting different forms of disaggregation, accompanied by spatial analysis, and the necessary mechanisms to aggregate urban data at country level.

Two of them (Marshall Islands and Tuvalu) are small Pacific states where geographic scale means a close overlap between national and local boundaries, and the other is Switzerland, a federal state in which the competence for urban policy is attributed to local authorities.\",\"In the Europe and North America region, most countries already implement NUPs. In contrast, about 40 per cent of the countries in Africa and Asia and the Pacific are currently in the stage of developing NUPs. However, the data show that some fast-urbanising global regions, such as the Arab States, are making serious efforts to put urbanisation on national agendas. Meanwhile, attention to climate change resilience and environmental sustainability is weakest, only 11 (10 per cent) of NUPs give extensive attention to climate change resilience and 28 (26 per cent) to environmental sustainability.\",\"Also, over 100 cities engaged in the City Prosperity Initiative have monitored urban expansion and population growth using the same methodology applied for the global sample of cities. Taking advantage of international meetings, specialized trainings were rovided to the large public on the definition, concepts and methods to measure this indicator. Further capacity-building efforts targeting NSOs and local governments are planned for 2018-2019 to promote the monitoring and reporting of the indicator. These technologies, when combined with ground-truthing support the development and refinement of models which can be applied at local, national, regional and global scales to generate high accuracy data for monitoring.\",\"It is particularly crucial for national governments to empower local governments by providing adequate financial resources, legal and fiscal autonomy and by supporting local skill development, given their important role in the NUP processes. With clearer information on common implementation gaps, and the policy instruments that are available to address them, policy makers could better predict these gaps and undertake capacity building activities. As Table 7.1 illustrates, many of the SDGs have an evident urban dimension and cannot be achieved without being addressed in urban areas, making NUPs an important implementation and monitoring instrument. As an overarching process, the national urban policy will be able to anchor and influence many dimensions of sustainable development, such as air pollution control and regulation\\\" (United Nations, 2016a).\",\"The total response rate of the UIS metadata survey was 32 per cent, with 66 of 207 countries and territories responding. The response rate varied greatly between SDG regions. Europe\\u002fNorth America and Northern Africa\\u002f Western Asia had the highest response rates with 59 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively.\",\"Moreover, the indicators should be developed which support the monitoring of the Global Goals for Sustainable Development (SDGs) adopted in 2015 by the UN General Assembly. This will ensure more accurate assessment of sustainable development progress and, if necessary, lead to adjustment of urban development policy. For example, a private construction practice of building several houses on six-acre (rural areas) and four-acre (urban areas) plots exists. It is essential to monitor this process and update development density and infrastructure indicators.\",\"Leadership: there needs to be both formal and informal political leadership from within government and\\u002for from other stakeholders to ensure the legitimacy of the NUP process and effectiveness of implementation. Inclusive and equitable: NUPs need to be inclusive and enable stakeholders to effectively engage in the process, making sure all voices are heard. Priority issues: a NUP should be people-centred, it needs to complement and not replicate strong sectorial strategies in areas such as infrastructure, water, energy, health, education, housing or social and economic inclusion policies.\",\"While national strategies are not the focus of this network, ACSN will help to improve the inter-operability of smart city initiatives among cities in the network, and will work towards creating opportunities to harmonise different national systems (ASEAN, 2018). The organisation’s scope of work includes advocacy, capacity building and training, research and knowledge management, project development and management, and decentralised co-operation. Regarding capacity building, UCLG ASPAC specialises in four areas that are of relevance for smart city strategies: sustainable mobility, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, tourism and culture, and local economic development. To promote capacity building, UCLG ASPAC has organised several training workshops and peer exchanges over the years.\",\"Analysing SNUPs in the context of the NUP will be an important future topic of study, although it was beyond the scope of this study. Many NUP processes examined had relatively little stakeholder participation, though this was highly variable at both the regional and national levels (Table 5.2). These include bilateral investment arrangements and multilateral trade partnerships.\",\"Governments should therefore be cautious in subsidising activities fostering the continued expansion of cities past their period of increased returns (OECD, 2011, OECD, 2015a). National Urban Policies (NUPs) are helping to co-ordinate action on productive, inclusive and resilient urban development. Myanmar moved the government to a new capital city, Nay Pyi Taw, in 2005, congestion in Yangon was a stated reason for the move. Its population is now close to one million. In 2017, the Indonesian government commissioned a survey by the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) on the possible relocation of the capital from Jakarta. Governments in the region have also moved some government functions outside of large capital cities without moving the capital.\",\"The capacity of institutions and individuals is central to the success ofaNUR which is why UN-Habitat and its partners develop tailored training programs to strengthen the ability of cities and municipalities to manage urban development with relevant data, knowledge and tools. To support the NUP process, training programmes are initiated through various conferences and workshops. These forums include elements such as national consultations, workshops and other capacity building and advocacy activities.\",\"The latter region pays almost the same amount of attention to human development as to economic development. In Africa, these are the two dominant themes. Latin America and the Caribbean's and Arab States' NUPs also pay the most amount of their attention to spatial structure. Environmental sustainability also gets low attention globally, although the results are more diverse across regions.\",\"Through Agenda 2063, Africa is committed to prioritizing urban housing, water, sanitation, energy, waste and rapid transit systems (AUC 2015) over the next five years, as stipulated in the first Ten-Year Implementation Plan (2014-2023) of Agenda 2063. This is the basis of the first Aspiration of Agenda 2063 that envisions a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development, with cities and urban settlements as hubs for cultural and economic activities. As a continent with the fastest rate of urbanization, implementation of Goal 11 and its related Agenda 2063 goals and targets -through effective planning, resource mobilization, monitoring and reporting - is critical to promoting sustainable urban living and sustainable development at all levels, local, national and global. Out of the 15 indicators, only six (40 per cent) have data and sufficiently-defined methodologies to measure progress (UNDESA, 2018, ECA and others, 2017).\",\"Central government is therefore the primary actor responsible for the development and implementation of NUPs. Jordan does not have an explicit NUP, but rather addresses urban issues through a range of sectorial policies and strategies, overseen by the relevant ministries. The National Land Use Master Plan of 2006, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, can still be singled out as a particularly relevant governmental policy with regards to managing and balancing urbanisation in the country.\",\"Coastal cities and human settlements often increase pressure on the environment. Indeed, pollution in oceans is often caused by pollution from cities. At the same time, achieving SDG 14 also reinforces sustainable urban planning and resilient settlements, given that urban development often occurs along coasts due to economic advantages and opportunities presented by coastal areas. The inter-linkages between SDG 11 on one hand and SDG 14 on the other are clear through the need to conserve our biodiversity.\",\"The OECD and United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN Habitat) co-led the Policy Unit and developed the Policy Paper on NUP, which was a key input to the drafting process of NUA. Subsequently, NUA has put explicit emphasis on NUPs as one of its five implementation pillars, and called for measures to enhance the ability of governments to develop and implement such over-arching policies (United Nations, 2016a). In addition, NUPs have been proposed as a monitoring tool for the SDGs through Indicator 1 l.a. The above developments therefore provide a unique window of opportunity to upscale the uptake of NUPs as a powerful policy process to help governments shape and implement better uiban policies for better lives, in a shared responsibility across local, regional and national levels. Implementing global frameworks through National Urban Policies (cont.) Promotes jurisdictional co-ordination and coherence through horizontal co-ordination of policies and plans across jurisdictions for the efficient, equitable and affordable deliveiy of basic services and infrastmcture, according to an agreed set of standards (UN Habitat, 2017).\",\"A similar trend is observed in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, with 74 per cent of NUPs (14 out of 19) at or beyond the implementation stage. In contrast, the majority of NUPs in the Arab States region are in their early stages, with 11 out of 17 NUPs in the feasibility, diagnosis or formation stage. The proportion of NUPs in these early stages is also high in Africa (45 per cent) and Asia and the Pacific (44 per cent).\",\"Available data for each indicator, or from proxies is used to discuss the progress or lack thereof on each target. Ongoing initiatives towards monitoring SDG 11 from regional and other country-specific reports are discussed. For each of the targets, we highlight the prevailing opportunities, challenges and policy implications, as well as best practices in data collection, institutional support offered by UN-Habitat to countries and other emerging partnerships.\",\"In particular, the human resources needed to tackle major policy issues are often lacking, especially technical capacity. Pacific nations face financial capacity deficits to undertake both NUP formulation and implementation, and fund the investments, such as waste treatment systems, anticipated by NUPs. Many countries in the region then have an overall weak local fiscal system that constrains their ability to resource their NUP. This section assesses the instruments that are used in the application of NUPs among the global regions studied in the report. A wide variety of policy instruments can be observed among NUPs - ranging from various types of strategic planning documents, spatial plans and master plans, national development plans, urban regulatory arrangements and national or subnational legislation, taxation policies and urban development funds.\",\"Both organisations look forward to continuing to join forces and support countries across the world in their effort to implement the New Urban Agenda. During the Habitat III process, the role of NUPs in supporting the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and other urban-related global agendas was increasingly recognised, and a range of tools and frameworks to assess NUPs have been discussed across international organisations and within national governments in countries. It establishes the foundation for understanding how and in what forms NUPs have been developed, implemented and monitored globally.\",\"A high value (near the outer circle of the diagram) indicates good performance. Dhaka, Ho Chi Minh City, Surabaya and Surat. The development of a joint monitoring framework is spearheaded by UN-Habitat in collaboration with various partners, and spells out a budgeted activity plan covering the next few years.\",\"Complexity may be a problem in some European jurisdictions with multiple and tiered governance arrangements. There is, therefore, no universal blueprint to dictate the specific way in which relations between different tiers of government are structured and regulated, as they depend on institutional traditions and the relative capacity of each level. However, a key opportunity can be found in a balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches in the NUP processes.\",\"The National Urban Policy Programme (NUPP) is meant to address these issues of governance, capacity and knowledge sharing to facilitate the development of NUPs and to contribute to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and other global agreements. Other objectives include direct assistance, such as providing training to policymakers and other relevant stakeholders to help them develop specialised skills to directly bridge the capacity gap or offering technical assistance and advisory services for every stage of the NUP cycle within a country. Finally, it also aims to build a platform for all levels of government, the private sector and civil society actors and any other relevant stakeholder to be engaged, network and exchange, to encourage transfer of best practices and policies, and raise awareness of NUPs.\",\"Among these are the urgent need to halt uncontrolled urban sprawl, reverse the growth of urban slum populations, institute smart, safe and efficient urban transport systems, improve urban environments through creating safe public spaces, manage air pollution and municipal solid waste, as well as promote sustainable buildings, ecosystem corridors and consumption and production patterns.. All the targets and indicators of SDG 11 require sufficient planning and informed strategies, which are largely articulated in the need to have well-informed national urban policies. Many of these indicators build on the notable achievements registered during previous global agendas especially MDGs and the Habitat Agenda, including the notable fact that some targets now have reliable baselines to work with, many others are new and come as a response to the challenges and opportunities that urban areas face today in search of sustainable development outcomes. These periods are sufficiently long for the global community to have learnt a lot about the existing challenges of implementing the SDGs and how to deal with the teething problems in monitoring and reporting.\",\"Quality of legal frameworks signifies the ability to produce the regulatory reforms required by policy makers. Effective legislation must have a clear purpose and introduce consistent and well thought-out rules and enforcement mechanisms, and unambiguous rules and obligations. Finally, it must allow for systematic monitoring and evaluation of the results of legislation. Implementing an evidence-based NUP process requires investment in civil services, research, university curricula and educational opportunities.\",\"This demonstrates that the substantive content of NUPs is highly contingent on regional and national contexts. In contrast, the two themes receiving the least attention are climate resilience and environmental sustainability. A relatively small proportion of NUPs offer only a low level (14 per cent) of engagement with human development issues.\",\"In Brazil, public participation is institutionalised in such arenas as the Conference of Cities at the federal level, and in city councils at the municipal level. Low engagement by civil society groups in NUP development is observed, partly due to a lack of participation mechanisms. However, Morocco's inclusive NUP process stands out as a potential model for the Arab States region (Box 5.4).\",\"This programme is strengthened and rendered truly effective and impactful through the wide engagement of stakeholders involved in the NUP process, from all levels of government, civil society, the private sector and academia, to bring about a stronger and more connected network, and to share more knowledge and experience. Matters of climate resilience or vulnerability, environmental sustainability or degradation, social equity or turmoil, economic competitiveness or decline, all converge in urban areas, and involve a variety of actors from all levels of government, civil society and communities, and domestic and foreign businesses. Recent global agreements, such as the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, the New Urban Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, illustrate this realisation, identifying the management of urbanisation as a global priority and a national responsibility.\",\"This study, building on regional studies by UN-Habitat and the OECD on the state of NUP for the 35 OECD member countries, provides a first attempt at assessing NUP trends, strengths and ways forward across member and non-member countries, and paves the way for the definition of a common methodology to monitor the progress of NUPs at the global level. In terms of NUP development stages, 92 countries (61 per cent) already implement their NUPs, whereas 58 countries (39 per cent) are in the process of developing NUPs. Only 19 countries (13 per cent) have reached the monitoring and evaluation stage. The stage of NUP varies by region.\",\"As defined in Chapter 2, the following five policy sectors are considered: economic development, spatial structure, human development, environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Section 4.3 presents a qualitative assessment of the goals and objectives of NUPs at the regional scale. Section 4.4 interprets the results and makes conclusions.\",\"Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that in some cases, even where a NUP is given a high level of priority in national policy development, resources are still lagging or uncoordinated. This includes national-level investment in linkages between major urban settlements. In the region, waste management has been a particular priority as has been the development of durable and affordable housing. Similarly, land management has been a target of resourcing. In some cases, national-level resourcing of urban infrastructure has been used as a wider economic stimulus. This is in addition to considerable levels of urban housing, infrastructure and transport development by sub-national governments, though not necessarily under the rubric of a NUP.\",\"First, the section provides an overview of context-specific priorities and challenges in terms of institutional arrangement at the regional scale. Then it discusses the need for a balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches in the NUP processes, by reviewing some country-specific examples. In some instances, responsibility is being delegated increasingly to subnational authorities, such as metropolitan governments.\",\"In contrast, environmental sustainability and climate change resilience receive much less attention, despite their centrality to both economic and human development. Many of the SDGs cannot be addressed without addressing environmental and climate change issues. National governments must give greater attention within their NUPs to environmental sustainability and climate-change resilience issues.\",\"Within this framework, NUPs are highlighted as being a primary tool for governments to articulate the implementation of such global commitments and the definition of a national vision for sustainable urban development, by engaging, coordinating and leading multiple actors across different sectors and scales. It aims to record the global advancement of NUPs as an indicator of the implementation of global agendas and to provide national governments, and other stakeholders involved in the NUP process, with more information and perspective for the successful development of a NUP. While it would be beyond the scope of a global report to provide a detailed blueprint for NUP development, as this should be tailored to national needs and aspirations, this report still highlights general opportunities, challenges, trends and best practices of NUP development at global and regional scales.\",\"Using remote sensing methods, the indicator can be measured in a cost-effective way in an unlimited number of cities. Research has shown that two main different approaches are used to measure this indicator (the degree of urbanization and the urban extent) that has very strong connections to other goals and targets. Although participation itself can be explained in different manners, no one denies the involvement of different actors in urban affairs is critical to build consensus and to take the most appropriate and informed actions. This data, which is mostly generated using spatial analysis technologies, is greatly challenging the traditional notion of the city unit and its boundaries, which were used to generate urban data.\",\"The following three sections discuss governmental authorities, institutional arrangements and stakeholder engagement, respectively. Finally, Section 5.5 interprets the results and provides conclusions. Nonetheless, in some instances, stakeholders were highly involved in NUP development, including in some systematic and highly participatory ways. These tended to be found in the North America and Europe, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions.\",\"Explicit NUPs show a higher extensive thematic attention to all the selected themes than partial NUPs, with economic development, spatial structure and human development equally drawing the extensive attention of half of explicit NUPs. Explicit NUPs pay less extensive attention to environmental sustainability and climate resilience, which is consistent with Figure 4.1, but to a much lesser extent than with partial NUPs. This thematic picture of NUP attention only considers the 108 NUPs that are in the formulation stage or beyond, out of 150 NUPs, and therefore does not reflect the emerging dynamics of 42 NUPs in elaboration.\",\"Out of the identified 150 NUPs, 43 (29 per cent) are in Asia and the Pacific region, followed by 38 (26 per cent) in Africa, 32 (21 per cent) in Europe and North America, 19 (13 per cent) in Latin America and the Caribbean and 17 (11 per cent) in the Arab States region (Figure 2.1). There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of the United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the \\\"Cyprus issue\\\".\",\"Goal 11 consists of 10 targets and 15 related indicators, majority of which are to be measured at the local city level and progress reported at the national level. ( These agendas and frameworks are particularly complementary and will require coordinated actions at local, national and global levels to achieve. For example, the embedding of a stand-alone goal on cities and human settlements (Goal 11) in the SDGs is a recognition of this complimentary and re-enforcing nexus. Some of the links between the SDGs 11 targets and other SDGs are clear e.g with SDG 1 on poverty or access to basic services, SDG 3 on health, SDG 4 on education, SDG 5 on gender equality, Goal 9 on building resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable industrialization, Goal 12 on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, SDG 16 on good governance, and SDG17 on partnerships and means of implementation, etc.\",\"Chapter 4 discusses the thematic scope of NUPs, assessing the level of attention given to selected sectorial policy themes related to urbanisation, as an indication to the extent that NUPs adopt a comprehensive view in dealing with the multi-sectorial nature of urbanisation. Chapter 5 focuses on the governance of NUPs, which should entail collaborative and coordinated institutional arrangements between all levels of government, and wide stakeholder engagement. The analysis focuses on the type of institutional authority leading the NUP process, on the extent of stakeholder engagement, and includes a discussion of the role of subnational governments in the NUP process.\",\"It requires not only an explicitly recognised urban policy setting at the national level, but also an institutional setting in which the NUP is properly led and co-ordinated (OECD, 2017a). Most countries, with a few rare exceptions, appear to acknowledge the strategic leadership and coordinating role of the national government, with the designation of leading urban agencies at the national level. However, the presence of a national-level agency is dependent on the political system and governance arrangements of a country, including any multilevel governance tiers, such as in a federal system.\",\"The report still indicates a certain thematic asymmetry in global NUPs. The most concerning aspect is the insufficient attention paid to matters of environmental sustainability and climate resilience. The growing recognition of the weight of urbanisation on environmental issues illustrated in the SDGs or the Paris Agreement, and the fact that extremely vulnerable regions such as the Arab States and Africa address it the least in their NUPs, calls for action to raise awareness, capacity and resources to integrate a concern for climate change and environmental issues much more strongly into NUPs.\",\"The New Urban Agenda insists on the necessity for capacity development, described as \\\"a multifaceted approach that addresses the ability of multiple stakeholders and institutions at all levels of governance, and combines individual, societal and institutional capacity to formulate, implement, enhance, manage, monitor and evaluate public policies for sustainable urban development\\\" (United Nations, 2016b). In the context of NUP development, capacity development entails making sure that governments have the means to engage in the development of the policy and to acquire the sufficient human, technical and financial resources to carry out their redefined responsibilities in the NUP process. Two factors of capacity are considered: commitment of resource and policy instruments.\",\"The NSC approach has been piloted in several countries including Botswana, Colombia, Ecuador, and Tunisia. Many of these tools were refined and modified in readiness for supporting the global monitoring of the urban SDGs. Other United Nations bodies have developed complimentary initiatives to support SDG 11 monitoring, one of the most recent being the United for Smart Sustainable Cities Initiative.\",\"The indicator puts emphasis on the interdependency, interconnection and complementary of these settlement systems. Currently, data can be measured for at least 108 countries with important level of thematic disaggregation, using the UN-Habitat National Urban Policy Database. This platform remains a key resource for monitoring progress on indicator 11.a.1 and the New Urban Agenda. Up to 180 countries are implementing National Urban policies.\",\"Although a very wide range of national policies can have a profound effect on urban development, national governments rarely review this impact systematically through an \\\"urban lens\\\" (OECD, 2014, OECD, 2015d). For example, fossil fuel subsidies negotiated at the national level clearly undermine local efforts to develop environmentally sustainable cities. A NUP can also connect all levels of government and other stakeholders by providing forums for the co-creation of a shared vision and a framework which enables them to move as one towards the stated goals.\",\"Regional patterns may be observed among NUPs, though these are not definitive. Taking them into account would assist nations developing and implementing NUPs to observe and learn from the experience of other nations, including sharing their experience of managing urbanisation at the national level. Regional networks of national governments may be an appropriate means through which to share NUP development practices and to identify what works and what does not work in given circumstances.\",\"As stated in the Policy Unit 3 Policy Paper, \\\"an ineffective NUP has a weak connection between economic development policies and other urban policies, resulting in a silo approach to governance\\\" (United Nations, 2016a). Countries can work to make direct and indirect linkages between NUPs and broader economic development policies and national development plans. It is not surprising that many NUPs address this theme, because it is widely recognised that cities are engines of national economic growth, and because maximising the potential economic benefits of urbanisation is, indeed, the main argument and the first incentive for countries to proactively manage urbanisation through national policies.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"10_nups_nup_national\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"10_nups_nup_national\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[-0.65294886,-0.69272894,-0.6874131,-1.3395884,-0.691235,-1.4339576,-1.3806762,-0.5877518,-1.1754334,-0.6665146,-0.69900584,-1.3884991,-1.0916836,-1.4354008,-1.1129797,-1.2650033,-1.3928502,-0.86468434,-1.365413,-0.5324787,-1.3041142,-1.4460436,-0.6898221,-1.3931143,-1.2259184,-0.64974606,-1.5034931,-1.2863902,-0.73128057,-1.3505907,-1.3894861,-1.423747,-1.2711495,-1.4336064,-1.3730745,-1.315484,-1.4235764,-1.360763,-1.3050395,-0.6192346,-1.4539583,-1.3873941,-1.5775306,-0.8657996,-1.3598704,-1.524801,-1.3807565,-1.1892794,-0.68441206,-0.65173155,-1.3516703,-1.3729646,-1.3333226,-1.1525549],\"y\":[3.7268667,3.5993874,3.5963948,3.762693,3.521282,3.7847435,3.4763906,4.0391784,3.8086095,3.5591824,3.6253672,3.7711275,3.6850038,3.7239711,3.7614741,3.702992,3.5006595,3.5956326,3.7557719,3.6323242,3.7780356,3.7375805,3.5731492,3.7870238,3.7398539,3.5648744,4.0880227,3.7626152,3.6036868,3.779473,3.484202,3.8459547,3.4631736,3.7069857,3.5796106,3.7580464,3.9037461,3.3554554,3.6988199,3.9838665,3.713554,3.493957,3.8862066,3.5809655,3.7702832,3.9549017,3.453141,3.7926195,3.5904422,3.7070646,3.8370843,3.749704,3.7734518,3.7005017],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"Figure 3.1 below show's federal, state and municipal natural protected areas. Its vision for development emphasises relatively affordable land, low labour costs and proximity to other central regions in Mexico. The state's precarious rural economy has also contributed to this vision - it has motivated a great number of farmers, mainly from the ejidos, to sell their agricultural land to real estate developers.\",\"Efforts to address these challenges are compounded by policy discontinuities that result from a change in the majority of the municipal administration every three years. The region’s transport network is characterised by congested highways and poorly maintained urban roads. As to water and wastewater management, in spite of the high coverage of water and sanitation in the Puebla-Tlaxcala metropolitan zone (reported at 87% and 96%, respectively [SEDESOL, 2012]), the frequency of water provision and quality of infrastructure remain inadequate.\",\"Even with the tremendous effort of draining the basin, seasonal floods remain a concern. Between 1980 and 2011, rain-related flooding incidents occurred every year and caused severe traffic disruptions, damages to business, homes and residents.2 During the rainy season, the metropolitan area experiences high-intensity rainfall in a short amount of time. A single storm can produce as much as 10% of the total average annual precipitation (see ANIS, 1995). The southern parts of the metropolitan zone, along the area with the highest elevation, exhibit high risk levels. But the area at risk extends north beyond high-risk municipalities and delegaciones along the border between the Federal District and the State of Mexico. From 2010 to 2013, the delegaciones and municipalities along the northeastern border between the Federal District and the State of Mexico experienced several severe spells of rain that led to declarations of states of emergency (Figure 4.1, left panel).\",\"In response to the low rate of collection by municipalities, the CAEM, the Water Commission for the State of Mexico, introduced a chargeback system, in which transfers to municipalities are reduced if they do not collect their fees. A lack of coverage with individual water meters results in a significant percentage of households paying fixed fees for their water. In the Valle de Mexico metropolitan area, only 52% of households are metered.\",\"The performance in solid waste and wastewater management is poorer in smaller cities. For example, only 5% of Class IV and V cities meet the national wastewater treatment criteria. Addressing this challenge necessitates the timely application of a clear and workable urban policy framework. A key to “getting cities right” is a holistic and integrated approach to urban challenges and policies.\",\"In addition, two connection options through Morelos may be envisaged. One of them would be a road that runs through Cuernavaca, reaches Zacatepec and continues up until Iguala, for which there is a rehabilitation project undertaken by the federal government. The second would be a new road going from Zacatepec to Cuautla. However, such projects may be substantially hindered by railway companies. They could negotiate an agreement with railway companies to achieve conditions that suit the specific requirements and parameters of the automotive industry'. This agreement would require the support of relevant state governments and the federal government.\",\"Grouping the State of Mexico with a large number of other entities makes it impossible to analyse waste management at the metropolitan level. According to the 2013-2018 Development Programme of the Federal District, 59% of the city’s territory is conservation land, located mainly in the south and southwest (see Chapter 1). The conservation land is critical for recharging the aquifers, improving air quality, protecting biodiversity, regulating weather and providing recreational opportunities, which in turn promotes eco-tourism.\",\"Federal funds are also used for the financing of the commission. These are autonomous in decision making but controlled by SEMARNAT in administrative issues such as human resources and finances. They include the National Water Commission (CONAGUA), the National Protected Areas Commission (Comision Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas, CONANP), the National Ecology and Climate Change Institute (Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico, INECC) and the Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (Procuraduria Federal de Protection al Ambiente, PROFEPA). Decentralised bodies exist as legal entities with their own budgets, such as the Mexican Institute of Water Technology (Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua, IMTA) and the National Forestry Commission (Comision Nacional Forestal, CONAFOR).\",\"Few of the region’s wastewater treatment plants function on a regular basis. As a result, the region’s water sources are reportedly highly contaminated and worsening (Iracheta Cenecorta, 2012). The Puebla-Tlaxcala metropolitan zone is no exception to this trend, and there is also evidence to suggest that urban sprawl may be a more prominent phenomenon in Puebla-Tlaxcala than in other metropolitan zones in Mexico.\",\"The State of Mexico has an initiative to protect forest lands, under w'hich the government gives a type of subsidy to land owners as an incentive not to build on the land. However, this scheme applies mainly to municipalities that are not part of the ZMVM. The preservation of the conservation land will not only require legal reinforcement, but adopting the technical instruments, such as land-use planning.\",\"Authorities of the State of Mexico have announced they are developing their corresponding new Mobility Law and programme, but details are not yet available. This section analyses the changes introduced by the Federal District. The new legislation reflects a shift from a transport policy focused on road management, evident in Article 3 of the former Law for Transport and Roads (Ley de Transporte y Vialidad, LTyV), to a mobility policy focused on “providing the necessary means to the population so that they can choose freely between different modes of transport in order to access goods, services and opportunities offered by the city” (Government of Mexico City, 2014a: Article 6). According to Article 6, “priority for the use of road space and distribution of budget resources will correspond to the following hierarchy of mobility: I. Pedestrians, especially disabled people and people with limited mobility, II. Users of public transport services, IV.\",\"The new legal framework adopted by the Federal District (and which is in the process of being developed by the State of Mexico) sets an important foundation for this by enlarging the scope of mobility policy and the responsibilities of mobility authorities. Success, however, will depend on strengthening the planning, regulatory and financial capacity of the authorities in charge of mobility policy. A crucial part of this process involves clarifying responsibilities where the outcomes depend on multisectoral strategies.\",\"The lack of funds has also complicated the introduction of cleaner vehicle technologies. While the entity would ideally have substituted a higher percentage of buses run on compressed natural gas (CNG), only 72 of the fleet of 1 360 buses have this kind of engine. Expansion towards the suburban areas in the State of Mexico has become increasingly necessary, and transport services need to provide a denser network, with alternative itineraries for corridors that are close to or above capacity.\",\"One study projects that urban land cover in Latin America could increase by 74% by 2050 if current densities remain constant - or by up to 187% if densities were to decrease by just 1% (Angel et al., In recent decades, population growth has been fastest in the municipalities surrounding the core municipality of Puebla, even if in absolute terms the city of Puebla has still accounted for a large share of Puebla-Tlaxcala’s growth. Of these, San Martin Texmelucan is the only municipality that does not border the city of Puebla.\",\"As noted earlier, the increasing marginal cost of urban water supply in most cities in the developing world points to the urgent need for more efficient use and conservation of the resource. At the same time, sanitation remains a critical priority. Together, these services represent essential building blocks for more resilient cities, while reducing the vulnerability of the poor.\",\"Authorities also adjusted remunerations by negotiating that costs that do not increase directly with travel would not be paid if operators travelled extra. The value threshold over which vehicles are no longer eligible for the 100% subsidy is MXN 250 000 (USD 18 800) in the Federal District, MXN 350 000 (USD 26 300) in the State of Mexico and MXN 550 000 (USD 41 400) in Hidalgo. This planning instrument takes different names depending on the country. In many contexts the word “plan” is substituted by “programme”. Its contents will therefore have to be adjusted to include all the elements, in line with best practice in developing transport master plans (see Box 3.4).\",\"The state benefits from a central position in the country and is accessible by various modes of transportation. As such, it presents numerous opportunities for short duration, one or two-day trips from Mexico City, whether organised by business organisations or families looking for recreational time in a greener environment. While access to the region may not be a primary issue, connectivity and accessibility within the region remains a major challenge.\",\"In the State of Mexico, the Ministry of Communications (through the department in charge of roads) always issues an opinion on the feasibility of incorporating road and pedestrian flows generated by developments in the existing road infrastructure. A positive opinion is required for the State Commission of Urban Development and Housing (which includes representatives of various ministries including the Ministry of Communications) to issue a proof of viability. This document is needed in turn for the Ministry of Urban and Metropolitan Development to grant construction authorisations.\",\"Around 7.5 million Mexico City residents live below' the poverty line. A high percentage of young women have no check-up during their pregnancy. Elderly people and disabled people cannot access health services because they are unable to go to the hospital or health centre. As part of this programme, the city sends physicians directly to the home of residents so that they can conduct check-ups and deliver prescriptions.\",\"With the exception of the city of Puebla, which has just updated its urban plan, most municipal plans in the state of Puebla are 15-30 years old. In Tlaxcala, only 4 of the stale’s 60 municipalities have updated or are conducting an update of their municipal plans. Even recent planning documents may be based on outdated or only partial data.\",\"For example, the Storm-Water Zoning Plan aims to: i) limit the amount of stormwater discharge into the River Seine, ii) minimise the stormwater that overflows wastewater control plans, and Hi) prevent flooding in the city. The purpose of the Zoning Plan is to provide urban planners and construction operators with recommendations and guidelines on new “alternative” techniques. These will include green roofs, gardens, lagoons and other green spaces, to encourage reuse and filtration of stormwater and to co-ordinate decision making in urban stormwater management processes. The aim is to collect the first inch of rainfall on 10% of the impermeable areas over the next 20 years. When it rains in New York City, the most densely developed city in the United States, a vast amount of runoff from rooftops, streets and other impervious surfaces is produced. If the key cause of runoff, impervious surfaces, is not kept in check, the DEP will have to spend more on tanks and tunnels to store stormwater flows, which will further swell with climate change.\",\"However, developing policy measures will be necessary to ensure that inclusive development is being pursued. Since NAFTA, the state of Morelos lost its absolute advantage of proximity to major markets and is now struggling to keep its position. The case study of Nissan is detailed below for illustrating the complexity and implications of accessibility and connectivity policies in relation to Morelos and regional economic growth. Together with other auto plants established in the state of Mexico and Puebla, the Nissan plant was built in the Cl VAC industrial park and operated from there until the 1980s with a relatively high degree of national integration in the supply of inputs.\",\"Asociacion Mexicana de Distribuidores de Automotores, Mexico, D.F., www .amda.mx\\u002findex.php?option=com content&view=article&id=598:como-quedaron-las-tenencias-en-2015&catid=73&Itemid=485 (accessed 11 August 2015).

This fragmentation of responsibility and recognition of the short-term risk of surface water flooding encouraged the Mayor to bring together key stakeholders to mitigate the risk.\",\"It is essential that implementation takes place before disasters strike, since prevention is the key to success. In terms of hard infrastructure, targeted investment in the drainage system should be considered in flood-prone neighbourhoods. The city’s drainage capacity (culverts, canals and conditioning lakes) is insufficient and unlikely to withstand disasters involving more than 100 millimetres of rainwater (City of Hai Phong, 2015).\",\"New extensions to several lines of the network are being planned in the near future by STC. The National Plan for Infrastructure 2014-2018 also establishes the commitment of the federal government to provide funding for the extension of Line A, which connects Mexico City and the State of Mexico (to be opened by 2017). Microbuses and RTP services were replaced by trolley buses in major avenues.\",\"This road connection between the Gulf and the Pacific would allow for cost and time savings for passing through Morelos and, more specifically, the Balsas river basin area. This will represent an important improvement to access international markets and strengthen commercial links with Puebla. Likewise, a project focused on tourist circuits in the southern state would take advantage of tourist attractions located in northern Guerrero and south-w'estem Puebla.\",\"In terms of infrastructure development, the Department of Wastewater and Storm Water Treatment for the Paris Metropolitan Area (Syndicat Interdepartemental pour I 'Assainissement de I ’Agglomeration Parisienne, SIAAP) has put in place a strategy based on demographic changes and the expansion of damp-proofing urban surfaces. This includes investment in new infrastructure (10 watersheds and 4 tunnels) to store 1.02 million m! Meanwhile, integrated strategic planning has also been set up.\",\"This effort was grounded in the idea that a local supplier base could be established in this area to supply both the Nissan plant in CIV AC and those of VW and Audi in Puebla. It has the road and rail infrastructure needed to distribute the company’s products to other regional markets in the United States. In addition, it is relatively close to the assembly plants of other companies that, altogether, form a strong supplier base in the west and north central regions of Mexico.\",\"Flood risk from storm water is particularly high in areas where storm-water infrastructure has not been adapted to elevated runoff in creeks coming from mountains, as in Santiago (Ebert, A. and J. McPhee [2009]). Urban expansion in the eastern part of Santiago towards the Andean piedmont has also increased the amount of impervious surfaces, contributing to increased risks from flood hazards (Romero, 2012). To reduce the risk of flooding and to increase absorption of storm water, between 2006-2010, the city of Chicago replaced the pavement in more than 100 alleys in the city with more permeable surfaces and plantings (OECD, 2012c, City of Chicago, 2010). Since 1997, storm-water infrastructure has been the responsibility of MOP and the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (Ministerio de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano\\u002fMINVU).\",\"There is too little water for current and future demand for potable water to be met from local sources. At the same time, torrential rainfall during the rainy season results in frequent flooding that affects residents, houses and infrastructure. Moreover, growing water demand, overexploited local and neighbouring aquifers and basins, ageing infrastructure, lack of investment, artificial low tariffs and high operation costs, and the deterioration of water quality have taken the water system to the limits of its physical and financial operability. The largest body of water is the artificially created lake “Nabor Carrillo”, with a surface area of about 10 km2, the sixth-largest lake in Mexico (CONAGUA, 2014a).\",\"It discusses recent projects and achievements in this direction, considers the challenges in building a coherent policy framework for the ZMVM and offers some recommendations based on international good practice. A final section addresses the Mexico City-Toluca train project and the New Mexico City International Airport. Central to achieving this is building a strong metropolitan co-ordination structure for mobility planning and implementation, aligning private and public actors to achieve consistency across policies and projects, moving away from reactive actions and developing long-term planning capacity, and assigning human and financial resources to generate the right technical expertise for the kind of policies that are coherent with new' priorities.\",\"Such transparency in the role of municipal- and state-level agencies, and good co-ordination between them, is particularly important in the State of Mexico and Hidalgo, where municipal governments usually receive the documents from the public but pass them on for evaluation by state-level agencies. Table 3.6 summarises the main studies required from developers included in the UK framew'ork and notes the need for strong analytical capacity in authorities evaluating this instrument. In the United Kingdom, transport statements are required for developments considered to have relatively small implications, but transport assessments are obligatory for developments likely to have more impact.\",\"This creates serious environmental and health risks given the inadequate wastewater and solid waste management system. Inadequate maintenance, and the possibility of accidental releases of unmonitored toxic chemicals and waste from industrial and port areas, require upgrading of the city’s storm drainage systems. Other “hard” infrastructure elements include eco-based adaptation measures such as retention ponds, creation of public open spaces or zoning restrictions in flood-prone corridors, early warning systems for floods, business continuity plans (BCPs), and disaster insurance and funds. Green infrastructure in particular includes adaptive solutions that allow “making space for water”, a concept now widely adopted in flood-prone countries like the Netherlands.\",\"The criteria for evaluating this requirement have been reduced to the turning in of the document, rather than to the evaluation of specific information and analysis in it. Analysis of the Mexico City-Toluca rail project is provided in the next section of this chapter.

The Toluca metropolitan zone is composed of 23 municipalities in the State of Mexico. See Government of Mexico City (2014d).\",\"Municipalities in the State of Mexico provide services mostly themselves, with the Water Commission of the State of Mexico (CAEM) having responsibilities transferred by some smaller municipalities. The CAEM co-ordinates action between municipalities and the federal government to improve water management, water and sanitation services and it provides technical assistance and develops infrastructure. In practice, all bodies of water are administered centrally by CONAGUA, which provides major infrastructure and water-related permits.\",\"The systematic inability of different levels of government to guide urban development has contributed to increasing levels of urban sprawl and the accumulation of severe service deficits that reduce the overall quality of life and may impair the metropolitan region’s future development. While these challenges are generally well understood by policy makers in Mexico, it has nevertheless proven difficult to address them due to weak urban planning (Herbert et al., Municipalities regularly authorise land subdivisions without updated master plans and without a metropolitan framework to gauge the long-term costs of the urban sprawl. Moreover, they are often operating with outdated land-use plans - some approved more than 25 years ago, when the region was a fraction of its current size - which do little to guide more sustainable development patterns.\",\"In many-metropolitan areas, smaller municipalities often lack the sheer human and technical capacity to prepare adequate plans or to update them, and require both training and funding from higher levels of government, as shown in the example of Puebla-Tlaxcala (Box 2.7). Municipalities have several planning instruments at their disposal with which to regulate and promote uiban development. However, most existing plans no longer reflect the demographic or spatial realities of municipalities.\",\"In particular, municipalities have been found to show a high degree of flexibility in granting land use authorisations. The decisions of municipal authorities that are incompatible with state planning may find several roots. The economic returns for municipalities and their mayors of delivering land use authorisations may also be identified as a reason for municipalities to grant permits that are undesirable from a state territorial planning perspective. A final political aspect may also be envisaged, that of the mayor who, after three non-renewable years in office, would take advantage of his authority to facilitate projects that may put him in a better position in a political party or group. Ejidos make up 75% of the urban territory of the state of Morelos (Gobiemo de Morelos, 2016a). Three types of property exist in Mexico: private property, which accounts for around one-third of the country’s land area, social property, which makes up more than half of the country’s territory, and public\\u002ffederal property, approximately 10% of the total, which includes national parks and waterways.\",\"Overexploitation has required wells to become deeper. They range up to a depth of 400 metres, where a depth of 70 metres was sufficient for older wells.6 Due to the soil composition, extraction from deeper wells tends to be less efficient. World Bank, Washington, DC, available at: www.agua.uiiam.mx\\u002fsacinex\\u002fassets\\u002fdocs\\u002fAcuaUitoana ValleMexic o.pdf. Reduction in water in the clay soil that supports a large part of the city leads to densification of the soil and subsidence.\",\"The delta area accounts for approximately 85% of the city’s area, which spreads out in such communes as Vinh Bao, Tien Lang, An Lao, Kien Thuy, An Duong, and the South of Thuy Nguyen. The delta area stands between 0.7 metres-1.7 metres above the sea level (City of Hai Phong, 2015). The city is vulnerable to flooding on a periodic basis, and tsunamis at any time, as well as being threatened over the longer term by sea-level rise, localised flooding due to more intense rainstorms (precipitation) and ocean storm surges.\",\"For Guerrero, such a road would have a significant impact on the development prospects of its northern region, comprising the northern Sierra de Guerrero slope and cities belonging to the so-called Tierra Caliente such as Iguala, Arcelia, Ciudad Altamirano. The state has rehabilitated the railroad to enhance the logistics platform in the eastern part of the state. It will also encourage the economic recovery in this region by providing rail freight services.\",\"For example, the Federal District should assign new BRS corridors to serve this area, co-ordinating with train schedules. This could contribute to tackling congestion, which in the case of Santa Fe has become a major issue affecting economic activity. Such a transformation would also greatly improve access for low-income residents and workers commuting to these areas. Careful analysis of full origin-destination demand patterns will shed light on the extent to which planned upgrades, such as the extension of a second underground line to reach the train station in Mexico City, can solve accessibility' problems, especially at times of high demand.\",\"Nochebus routes cover 330.8 kilometres and are available in 14 of the 16 delegaciones of Mexico City. The ORT is a new regulators' body that has been introduced by the New Mobility Law for the Federal District, but lias not yet been set up. The latest survey for users (2014) showed that 14% of users are residents of the State of Mexico.\",\"By extension, co-financing and conditionality mechanisms could be useful tools to bolster fiscal relations across levels of government. Finally, there are opportunities to give a more strategic role for the existing fora for sharing information, good practices and analysis on urban challenges in Mexico, SEDATU could follow up on the outcomes of these discussions. Modernising the municipal administration and, where appropriate, developing metropolitan governance arrangements, will be central to better urban planning and management. Measures could include enabling municipal re-election and\\u002for longer terms in office for mayors (recent federal legislation has already paved the way for this change, to be determined at state level), in addition to creating incentives for urban planning and introducing city managers (professional civil servants to guide the day-to-day administration within municipal administrations).\",\"For one, the country requires a long-term urban development agenda discussed with all political forces and with the participation of civil society. Additionally, Mexico needs to improve its capacity to conduct and implement urban planning as past urban development projects have too often been characterised by an improvised, trial-and-error approach responding to short-term political priorities rather than the national long-term interest. To do so, it will be important to strengthen the sectoral leadership, promote cross-sectoral planning, and in the long term, streamline the housing and urban development sector. To do so, it is critical to align local housing and urban development legal frameworks to national strategic objectives, reduce transaction costs for and asymmetries of information across levels of government, promote integrated urban development and management, and revamp metropolitan governance arrangements.\",\"Such a plan should consider both the threat of flooding from inland, upstream areas that flow into Hai Phong, as well as coastal flooding caused by sea-level rise, erosion typhoons or storm surges. Wider co-ordination with surrounding provinces would be critical for such a plan to be effective.

The current account deficit (including grants) improved to 3.6% of GDP (from 5.7% in 2014) due to lower oil prices and more volume exports of gold, improving the terms of trade to 15.2% (from 5.3% in 2014). The current account deficit is expected to be entirely funded by foreign direct investment (FDI) in gold and telecommunications and by foreign loans.

Capital markets in Emerging Asia - Stable but headwinds persist10 (cont.)\",\"The 2015 budget, like those of 2013 and 2014, was developed and implemented under the programme-budgeting method. Monetary policy was aimed at stabilising prices and the real effective exchange rate by preventing public expenditure from crowding out private investment. Inflation increased in 2015 by 0.8 of a percentage point to 2.7% because of the rising price of fuel at the pump, itself due to a 40% cut in subsidies to oil products in July 2014, but remained under the 3% CEMAC convergence criterion. The worsening security environment held back growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) to an estimated 4.1% in 2015, compared with an initial target of 5.5%.\",\"By comparison, the US dollar has generally strengthened against the currencies of its trading partners since April-May 2018, and this is mirrored by the trend of the DXY index in a tight-knit fashion.9 Notably, the Chinese currency’s NEER depreciation is shallower than its depreciation against the US dollar on a bilateral basis. These trends suggest that the exchange rate dynamics involving this currency pair are more about the strength of the US dollar than the weakness of the Chinese yuan thus far. Among the region’s currencies, the rupee, the rupiah and the Myanmar kyat weakened most against the US dollar last year, although they have been on an uptrend since November-December 2018.\",\"Moving forward, policy directions are expected to diverge. Most of the ASEAN-5 economies are gearing for fiscal consolidation, while the other Emerging Asian countries are looking to take an expansionary path. Weakening sentiment in the first quarter of 2019 is underpinned by trade tensions and the slowdown in China’s growth. Nonetheless, private consumption is holding up well. Overall, growth rates in 2019 and 2020 are expected to remain high, at 6.2% in Emerging Asia and 4.9% and 5.0%, respectively, in ASEAN.\",\"The rising trade tensions may affect Emerging Asia through various channels, including global value chains, foreign investment, trade diversion and exchange-rate reaction, among other channels. In the near term, the speed at which exports adjust to the price shock caused by new tariffs will partly determine the impact of trade tensions on sectors and the economy as a whole. On the upside, the ongoing shifts in import sourcing present an opportunity for Emerging Asian countries to adjust their investment and export strategies.

Exports of Thai electrical machinery to other countries as a collective has been fairly subdued at a time when exports to China are contracting, yet there appears to be budding momentum in export growth of these goods to Japan and the Philippines. Similar to Thailand’s exports of vegetables, the adjustment speed of exports to other countries is slower than the adjustment of exports to China. Nonetheless, at the country-level, data show a marked uptick in exports to Italy and Lao PDR, and to a certain extent, to Australia and the United States. Growth in Viet Nam’s exports of computers and electronics to other partners as a group has gained momentum since late 2018, helping to offset the weakness in exports to China albeit the average growth from September 2018 to May 2019 is still weaker than the average growth in the prior eight months. Key markets providing the boost include Italy, Russia and Panama.\",\"The services and industry sectors led the expansion during this period. Growth in the agriculture sector, however, was moderate in part due to fluctuations in weather conditions. For 2016 and 2017, sustained investments to address energy and transport infrastructure constraints, continued progression in industry and a recovery in services are expected to lead growth. Agriculture is projected to grow at a moderate rate.\",\"Mechanisms to support public-private partnerships (PPPs) and access to banking for local communities therefore need to be promoted. However, the country’s pace of economic activity moderated in 2014, reflecting modest growth in mining and persistent electricity and water supply problems. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated to have weakened further in 2015 mainly due to subdued demand for mineral exports on account of the gloomy global economy.\",\"While the growth trends are somewhat comparable for certain commodities, the speed of adjustment between commodities and markets differs (Figure 1). These dynamics are presumably determined by the macroeconomic structure, extent of global value chain involvement of each sector in the economy, free trade agreements and investment linkages, among other factors. Commodity nomenclatures are not necessarily the same across countries. In this regard, concerns mainly revolve around the movement of the Chinese yuan.\",\"As such, the impact will likely be uneven across Emerging Asia. Other potential effects could come in the form of increased price pressures and disruption in supply channels leading to difficulties in disposing inventories. Though it is challenging to pin down the speed of adjustments and the patterns of re-allocation caused by the trade tensions, the export data of Thailand and Viet Nam by commodity and partner country yield some notable findings.\",\"The slower gross domestic product (GDP) growth was due to lower than expected exports and a decrease in public expenditure and foreign direct investment. A reduced influx of hard currency assisted the devaluation of the metical (MZN) against the US dollar and pressured the balance of payments. This was halted only by a USD 282.9 million standby credit facility agreement with the International Monetary Fund in December 2015. The budget deficit was reduced from 6.6% in 2014 to 5.4% in 2015.\",\"The CABs of the CLM economies (Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar) remained in the red, weighed down by imports of capital and durable consumer goods. The CABs of China and India are declining, although China’s balance remains in surplus. In both countries, export growth pulled back relative to the rate in the previous year.\",\"Moving forward, policy directions are expected to diverge. Most of the ASEAN-5 economies are gearing for fiscal consolidation, while the other Emerging Asian countries are looking to take an expansionary path. Trade tensions underpin the weakening economic performance. However, domestic private consumption is holding up well.\",\"In Myanmar, however, the persistent weakness of the kyat has fuelled a rise in domestic prices, and in China, supply-side pressures have pushed food prices upwards. Thailand raised interest rates as a precautionary measure against risks in the real estate market, while China, India, Malaysia and the Philippines have eased monetary controls to a certain degree. Nevertheless, the overall balance-of-payments positions have remained in good stead.\",\"Production is expected to pick up in 2020 (IEA, 2019). The generally ample supply of key staples like rice, coupled by a continuation of support measures in many countries, should help to keep food prices stable for the rest of the year. While El Nino poses risks to agricultural production this year, the impact has been generally mild thus far. The continuation of price support and similar measures should also limit a base effect induced inflation push.\",\"Malaysia’s trade position improved, but it was outdone by a net outflow in gross transfers. In the Philippines, payments for capital and intermediate goods imports continued to drive the widening of trade and current account deficits, although this was partially offset by robust remittance inflows from overseas workers. Thailand’s large trade surplus shrank, while a deficit in primary income transfers increased. Viet Nam saw its net trade earnings rise substantially in the first half of 2018 from the previous year, and this more than matched an increase in net transfer outflows. Elsewhere in the region, Singapore’s CAB stayed healthy in 2018 on the strength of its net goods trade position, while Brunei Darussalam’s surplus decreased.\",\"Reliance has been decreasing since reaching a high of 5.8% in 2015, but a negative shock to the UK economy could be damaging to Cambodian trade. The potential impact of Brexit on Cambodia’s textile industry (cont.) If the United Kingdom crashes out of the EU single market without a deal on its subsequent relations, its EU trade treaties would become invalid.\",\"One of the most prominent risks is the trade tension between the United States and China. The rising trade tensions may affect Emerging Asia through various channels. Import growth from ASEAN showed signs of improving in March 2019, but prospects are uncertain. While new tariff measures were announced in May 2019, the resumption of trade talks during the G20 summit sends a positive signal. The downturn in China’s imports since late 2018 has affected ASEAN to varying degrees.\",\"Inflation was kept below 10%. The budget deficit widened to an estimated 4.6% of GDP in 2015, from 2.3% in 2014, and the current-account deficit deteriorated from 0.2% to 2.3% of GDP, so macroeconomic stability remains fragile and food insecurity is still a concern. Consequently, Madagascar still has a poor Human Development Index of 0.510, ranking the economy as 154th in the United Nations Development Programme’s 2015 Human Development Report.\",\"India aims to steady its deficit ratio in the coming fiscal years. The shortfall in fiscal year 2018 (ending March 2019) will likely exceed the initial target and deficit ratio set in the previous year. The trade tensions could affect economies in the region via global value chains, foreign investment, trade diversion and exchange-rate reaction, among other channels.\",\"Nonetheless, export data by commodity and partner country yield some notable findings. As can be gleaned from Figure 1.12, exports of certain goods to China from Thailand and Viet Nam exhibit somewhat comparable trends over the year through April-May 2019. Commodity nomenclatures are not necessarily the same across countries.\",\"The fiscal position was healthy with an overall deficit of 3.4% of GDP in 2013\\u002f14. Similar prospects are expected over the medium term. Successful and peaceful general elections in October 2015 transferred power to a new president who has committed to prudent resource management, fighting corruption and pursuing inclusive growth.\",\"The government is also creating an attractive environment for the active participation of local and foreign private investors. However, these efforts are being severely curtailed by unresolved border issues, the government’s relatively substantial spending on security, the UN sanctions and macroeconomic instability. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to slow from 1.7% in 2014 to 0.3% in 2015 because of slower economic activity and increasing challenges in the global market.\",\"However, exports contracted anew after a mild recovery in Q4 2018 (Figure 1.6). Continuation of price support measures, and recent tourism incentives like visa waivers, tax breaks and free flights to second-tier destinations, should buoy private spending.

Public infrastructure projects and the commencement of gold production will support estimated GDP growth of 2.8% in 2016, but the drawdown of the United Nations peacekeeping force will reduce demand for services while requiring the government to assume full responsibility for the security sector and its costs.

The Thai baht has outperformed the region’s other currencies during this period, while the Indian rupee and Myanmar kyat have weakened the most.\",\"Exports grew markedly, propelled by shipments of petroleum and manufactures. Private consumption growth was also solid, anchored by election spending, stable bank credit flows and an easing of inflation. Capital formation was supported by a decline in secondary-market interest rates and a steady inflow of FDI during the year. Government spending likewise expanded strongly, though less so than the previous year.\",\"Budget policy was tighter because of lower government revenue but the primary deficit still reached 9.3% of GDP in 2015. The current account deficit widened (with lower oil prices) from 2.6% of GDP in 2014 to 14.5% in 2015. Overall growth should be 4.2% in 2016 and 4.7% in 2017, driven by greater oil production from new wells and by robust transport and agriculture sectors.\",\"The stock of public debt rose from just below 70% of GDP at end-2010 to 108% by end-2015. Consequently, interest payments on public sector debt increased to absorb 40% of government revenues in 2015, up from 25% in 2013. The outlook for 2016 is clouded by policy slippages related to financing another large programmed deficit of 9.3% of GDP. Associated with the fiscal deficit, Gambia experienced a significant balance of payments crisis, which led to a decrease in its official reserves from six months of import cover at end-2012 to less than three months in early 2016.\",\"Mild deficits are expected in the next two years, with the government aiming to maintain the growth rate, although the potential removal of its trade privileges could lower revenue realisation. With Lao PDR’s deficit ratio remaining at around 5% in 2018 (World Bank, 2019) and its debt ratio becoming a concern, the country imposed spending restrictions (e.g. limits to the allowances of government officials and vehicle purchases) to narrow the gap in 2019 and 2020. Similarly, Myanmar moved to raise tax collection and rein in spending in the near term to deal with persistently wide budget shortfalls.\",\"Consumer confidence has remained upbeat, and this is mirrored by the robust retail sales growth. The stabilisation of the rupiah in recent months and the tapering of interest rates in the secondary debt market since September-October 2018 augur well for business operations and for public and private capital spending. Tax cuts for exporters who keep their earnings in the domestic banking system should strengthen external buffers, while the adjustment of the negative list and new rules on tax holidays look positive for investment.\",\"Direct investment, portfolio and other investment flows have propped up the balances of countries with current account deficits. Fiscal policy direction will be mixed in the near term. The stability in the fiscal positions of the region’s economies has remained intact at the close of recent fiscal years.\",\"There was 7% growth in 2014 and preliminary estimates indicate the same growth rate in 2015, driven mainly by the services, industry, construction, and information and communication sectors, each of which grew in double digits. For the medium term, growth is projected to outperform the records of 2014 and 2015, increasing to 7.2%. While other sectors are expected to at least perform at their recent levels, higher growth performance is expected largely from increased industrial activities and investment in infrastructure.\",\"Fiscal management requires judicious policy actions moving forward. The budget deficit has been persistently high the last few years, resulting in a marked rise in the government debt-to-GDP ratio. While the imposition of appropriate spending restrictions is helpful, the falling revenue-to-GDP ratio needs attention. Furthermore, sustaining growth requires the leveraging of economic gains from electricity and mining production and from infrastructure projects (e.g. the railway from Lao PDR to China) to develop other industries. For instance, agriculture could use additional investment to enhance its climate resilience, operational efficiency and productivity. Despite the movement of labour to other sectors over the years, agriculture still accounts for more than 60% of total employment.\",\"Meanwhile, in Viet Nam, fruits and vegetables seem to adjust less quickly than computers and electrical products. This indicates that the speed of adjustment tends to vary by commodity and by country, which is presumably determined by the macroeconomic structure, extent of global value chain involvement of each sector in the economy, free trade agreements and investment linkages, among other factors. The dip in exports of electrical machinery began more recently and less pronouncedly than that of edible vegetables, though in both cases the weakness appears to be persistent. In the case of Viet Nam, the trend of declining growth in fruit and vegetable exports to China also began earlier than that of computers and electronics, which started to edge lower late in 2018, although both categories appear to be recovering in 2019. The speed of upward adjustment of exports this good to other markets is substantially slower than the downward adjustment of exports to China.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"12_trade_exports_2019\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"12_trade_exports_2019\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[0.6181688,0.88232046,0.56306344,0.61069334,0.60248566,0.8691956,0.60231954,0.86863863,0.8408244,0.90067375,0.58587617,0.6016394,0.8398164,0.9166139,0.9174845,0.6508935,0.62453866,0.9662897,0.93119496,0.5840724,0.9254963,0.8614444,0.8587604,0.6476548,0.91048706,0.9118958,0.8956214,0.5432382,0.8115644,0.9343371,0.59006757,0.6110487,0.66685814,0.64731383,0.8508661,0.6315692,0.5975783,0.5758524,0.812544,0.67866737,0.70486253,0.5996867,0.7793109,0.91980547,0.7487121],\"y\":[0.68248016,0.49352556,0.70697916,0.68847245,0.72934496,0.50788474,0.7042497,0.506084,0.5337065,0.47563425,0.70643413,0.7183031,0.5386187,0.46179914,0.4629858,0.75131154,0.74325347,0.4133861,0.44855958,0.7054224,0.4568602,0.5145599,0.5143393,0.7512255,0.46837494,0.46554577,0.47760448,0.7421046,0.53954214,0.4430052,0.6866196,0.73574674,0.6308687,0.785996,0.5252866,0.6836122,0.7067051,0.71353745,0.55111027,0.62978226,0.6158028,0.7839085,0.62067676,0.45830694,0.60180813],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"In Europe, relatively weak labou Germany is the preferred destination economic conditions of migrants, as it received close to 1.1 million migrants and refugees in 2015, more than one per cent of its population.101 This in part can be attributed to Germany's initial welcoming approach and more favourable economic situation. Besides, Germany has an established quota system for the distribution of asylum seekers among its federal states, based on their tax income and population density. Few countries such as Sweden and Austria have taken a large number of refugees relative to their population.\",\"Over time, levels of internal migration have been stable or declining since the 1990s, with China being a notable exception. The impact of internal migration on the spatial distribution of populations is greatest in countries with intermediate levels of internal migration,5 which, in the process of urbanization and development, experience large regional economic differentials that spur migration. For high-income countries, which are generally well advanced in this process, most internal movements are between urban areas.\",\"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe was a major source of migration, with people moving to the Americas, Australasia, and Central Asia. Another considerable migration flow was from Southern China into Southeast Asia. Today's Europe is mostly a destination for migrants from Africa, Asia, and the Americas, as well as a locus for major internal migration flows, while migration to North America originates mostly in Latin America and Asia.\",\"If the migrants return home, they are considered return migrants, if they migrate to another place again, they are considered stepwise migrants.

An important first step could be the consolidation of existing yet scattered resources, data, indexes, tools and studies. It is important to assemble this information in a global database and promote greater information-sharing and dialogue among cities, multilevel government stakeholders and other partners.\",\"Forcibly displaced persons comprise refugees, asylum seekers, persons in refugee-like situations and internally displaced persons. The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees defines a refugee as someone with a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons related to race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, who resides outside their country of nationality and who is unable to return to it. In Africa, persons fleeing armed conflict and violence are also considered refugees (see box 3).\",\"As highlighted in the literature for Asia, there are cases of internal migration leading to international migration, but there are also cases of equally important international movements from rural areas without prior internal migration.4 Migrants may also transit through countries before reaching their final destination country. While international migration flows are relatively well documented, data on migratory movements to and from rural areas - both within and between countries - are much more difficult to come by. Definitions for statistical and other purposes differ widely from country to country, making cross-country comparisons problematic.\\\"\",\"Although reliable figures are lacking, it is believed that most environment- and climate-related migration takes place over relatively short distances and only rarely involves cross-border movements.30 While many victims of disasters are able to return to their homes in a relatively short period of time, in some cases they live in protracted situations or require permanent relocation. Since hazards relating to climate change and environmental degradation are likely to increase in frequency and intensity, disaster-induced displacement could well become more widespread in the future. Migration and development can be considered two sides of the same coin.\",\"Recent cross-national studies4 show large variations in levels of internal migration across countries and both within and between geographic regions. Measured over a period of one year or five years, high levels of internal migration are generally found in high-income countries in Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), Northern America, Northern and Western Europe and Eastern Asia (Japan and the Republic of Korea). Internal migration has been generally low in Eastern Europe and in South-Central, South-Eastern and Western Asia. Substantial variation exists among countries in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean.\",\"Voluntary repatriation, the most common solution, may be promoted through “go and see” visits, education, legal aid and family reunification, along with development programmes in returnee areas prioritizing health care and infrastructure. Measures to promote local integration may include granting refugees freedom of movement and access to the labour market and to basic services. Successful resettlement of refugees in third countries can be facilitated by providing cultural orientation, language and vocational training and access to education and employment.\",\"Both indicators are associated initially with increasing and subsequently with declining levels of emigration, corresponding to the inverted U-curve relationship. Both indicators also have an overall positive effect on immigration. Development in poor countries will help incomes grow, enabling people exiting poverty to cover migration costs, therefore these countries will initially see rising levels of emigration. Eventually, once countries reach a certain level of development and are able to bridge the income gaps, migration levels will start declining again. Caution should therefore be used in concluding definitively that all countries have had or will follow the described path.\",\"Previous experience of refuge crisis shows that migrants can, eventually become valuable contributors to the economic and social development of countries. Other German cities like Munich, Diisseldorf, Stuttgart and Freiburg have established ‘welcome departments' within their city halls to prepare for the arrival of refugees. Over the past two decades, urban population growth and the effects of globalization have enhanced the complexities and manifestation of crime and violence in cities. One study showed that 60 to 70 per cent of urban residents have been victims of crime in those developing or transitional countries where rapid urban population growth is at its highest.\",\"Engaging migrants in local partnerships builds trust among the migrants themselves, the city and the host community, and increases migrants' visibility in the social fabric of the city. While the contribution of migrants to development in their communities of origin has long been recognized, empowering migrants as actors in their cities of destination could also enhance their human and social potential for co-development. Attracting migrants with appropriate skill levels helps the local economies to be competitive and to meet existing labour shortages and skills needs.\",\"Migration policies should seek to minimize the potential negative impacts of migration on countries of origin, including loss of human capital and separation of families, and to maximize the potential benefits by reducing the transfer costs of remittances, promoting the recognition of skills and credentials, ensuring the portability of earned benefits and supporting the engagement of diaspora groups and communities in their countries of origin. The development of standardized definitions and categories for the delimitation of cities and urban agglomerations is needed to facilitate the effective review and evaluation of progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and targets related to sustainable urbanization. Where necessary, standardized concepts and definitions should be developed on topics such as internal and international migration, short-term mobility, and circular and return migration. Concerted efforts are required to accelerate the development of methodologies to measure migration-related indicators of sustainable development and to generate data on key development targets that are disaggregated by migratory status.\",\"Migration to, from or between rural areas is an important component of both internal (within countries) and international (between countries) migration. Due to the complexity of factors driving rural migration, it is usually a multifaceted process that takes different forms. These rural migration flows are closely linked to agricultural and rural development in a bidirectional relationship: agricultural and rural development affects migration, but at the same time is itself affected by migration (see Box 4 for a list of terms describing various migration types and patterns).\",\"Labour legislation regulates maximum working hours, industrial safety, minimum wages and benefits for workers and the prevention of child labour, but enforcement, if any, is weak. Therefore, the immigration laws applicable in Western countries cannot be applied to these workers. T.

Emigration rates in middle-income countries have been found to triple those of low-income countries. Furthermore, in developing countries at the early or intermediate stages of the demographic transition, emigration is spurred by the large cohorts of relatively well-educated young people entering the labour market. Migration can also propel economic development through increased labour productivity.\",\"These linkages have multifaceted positive impacts on individuals, families and communities. The potential for the co-development of urban and rural communities exists but requires partnerships between the migrants and the local authorities of both communities as well as support from national governments. It assists to shift the focus away from why people move to how they work, live and shape their habitats. Cities across the development spectrum have growing mobile and diverse populations to manage. In developed countries, one of the main sources of population diversity is international migration while, in less-developed countries, it is most likely internal migration1 and, to a lesser extent, growing international South-South migration.\",\"Migration often represents a strategy on the part of households to manage the risks of poverty and food insecurity, allowing them to diversify income sources. The two are distinct, but they are also interlinked. The drivers and impacts of both migration types are often similar, although they may be different in scale.\",\"These studies reinforce the general argument that migrations around the world from rural areas to the big cities are part of a two-stage process. Its political institutions, business relationships, social networks and transactions are all footholds intended to give new village arrivals a purchase, however fragile, on the edge of the large society, and to give them a place to push themselves, and their children, further into the centre, into acceptability, into connectedness. While many still live in slums, they have clearly been receding as a proportion of the urban population over the last two decades.\",\"In reality migration decisions are complex, and choices are rarely made without constraint. For instance, when livelihoods are threatened by slow-onset events such as climate change and environmental degradation, the distinction between forced and voluntary migration may not be clear-cut. The term \\\"survival migration\\\" has sometimes been used to refer to migration induced by conditions of extreme economic difficulties. The important point is that in reality, migration decisions are complex and depend on multiple factors. They are best viewed as lying along a spectrum in which elements of choice and coercion intermingle and can be more or less predominant depending on circumstances and context. Totally forced migration generally occurs in the form of displacement (often over short distances) in response to direct threats to life caused by natural or human-made disasters or by armed conflicts.\",\"This been reported by earlier studies from Delhi (Anand and Tiwari, 2005)16, and Chennai (Srinivasan, 2008)17.

In some cases, returning migrants aremotivated by a desire to live closer to family members who can care for them in old age or to seek affordable institutional care. Some studies suggest that migrants from some Central and Eastern European countries who had returned to their country of origin within 10 years of emigrating represented between 6 and 8 per cent of the adult population of those countries.\",\"They can contribute to the growing interconnections between cities through sustained global communications, institutional linkages and the exchange of resources among migrants, homelands and wider diasporas. Migrants as builders of resilience: Migrants also play an important role in building the resilience of home and host communities through the exchange of resources and support. Migrants and their networks can contribute to managing risk for the community at large.\",\"City Akimats prefer to w'ork with their own statistics rather than with official figures. Job-seekers moving to Almaty, for example, often encounter difficulty finding housing and work legally, so they take refuge in micro-districts on the outskirts of the city where they are not officially registered, do not own property and have limited access to public services (Makhmutova, 2012). In the absence of the cities’ readiness to accept and accommodate new residents, they join informal economic sectors.24 By settling in cheaper peripheral areas around large cities, migrants contribute to urban sprawl. Since land and property prices are high, they usually occupy rural land and build individual houses from the cheapest accessible local materials (e.g. clay) with poor amenities (furnace heating and no central sewage system), and are vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquake and flooding.25 Migrants living in unauthorised housing such as former dachas?6 have no valid address and thus no official status. Not all migrants are highly educated, but they are highly motivated and entrepreneurial. They bring a diversity of skills and competencies to the urban economy necessary for development.\",\"Globalization scholars have pointed to the changing nature of the global economy and its impact on American cities, for instance. Middle-class workers who until recently had secure formal-sector jobs and reliable safety nets now find themselves expelled from the labour market. “ Expulsions” instead of forms of exclusion are taking place in these countries with social groups who until just a couple of decades earlier were secure participants in formal labour markets.10 Moreover, informal workers in developed countries are mostly undocumented migrants from lower-income countries who, because of their legal status, fear going to the police or seeking out legal help, thus further entrapping them within these informal conditions. In the US, for instance, the neighbourhood of Harlem in New York City was documented to have a thriving informal economy exceeding one billion dollars.13 The findings of the study led a large American bank to recognize the financial demand at the bottom of the pyramid and to open two new branches in Harlem.\",\"This in turn may leave a vacuum in specific rural areas in the country of origin, which then leads to internal migration across rural areas. Alternatively, when sources of internal migrants to cities become exhausted, international migration can substitute for internal migration, as has happened in developed countries. This highlights how measures linked to purely internal or international migration may not lead to the desired policy outcome unless the other dimension is also considered.\",\"The Austrian government has created a legal framework that balances rights and obligations between the city authorities, companies that manage private housing and the incoming migrants. Migrant-oriented urban policy packages for large cities should differ from urban policy packages covering smaller towns, but it should be acknowledged that internal migration affects not only cities but also towns and villages. National authorities may wish to analyse the experience of the Baltic Sea countries in improving the system of public service provision to migrants by delinking it from registration status and using the existing identification number system (INS) instead (Tukmadieva, 2015).\",\"While acknowledging the vast differences between international and internal migration scenarios, and also between the ability of rich, emerging countries and poor countries to deal with these, this report has highlighted the growing evidence of the potential benefits of all forms of migration and mobility for city growth and development. In order to maximize the developmental benefits of these new mobility patterns in terms of improving migrant well-being, it is imperative for cities to put inclusive urban policies in place for basic services and socioeconomic inclusion. They can be architects and construction workers of growing cities, service providers, entrepreneurs, employers and innovators. As part of the global diaspora, they can facilitate business and humanitarian support between cities and countries.\",\"However, cities also present potential opportunities, such as increased economic independence and capacity to challenge rigid gender norms. At the same time inequalities in access to health care between migrant and non-migrant populations exist in many urban locations which affect the individual and public health of urban communities. Migrants themselves can play a key role in building resilience.\",\"As a consequence of this strong migration tendency, the city is faced with an employment challenge for these populations and encounters strong spatial segregation concerning migrant populations. A potential solution to the mismatch between demand and supply in the Hamburg employment market is to encourage self-employment for migrants, promoting business making. Such a solution has the strong advantage of encouraging integration in the formal economic sector, and the potential to develop the local economy.\",\"It may occur within a country or it may require crossing an international border. It may be short term\\u002ftemporary or long term\\u002fpermanent. Based on the area of origin and destination, this migration can also be classified as: rural-rural migration, rural-urban migration, urban-rural migration, or urban-urban migration. Although there is no consensus on how long the period should be for defining this type of migration, a range of 3-12 months is frequently found in the literature.\",\"The city has a population of about 220 000 but is ringed by smaller towns and cities. Because it was a walled city and then a free city for most of its history, it has a relatively constrained administrative area with a lot of small uibanised areas in close proximity. The city remains a major port and has some manufacturing strengths, but has been eclipsed by Hamburg.\",\"In these countries, migratory flows usually begin with internal displacements which, depending on the intensity and the duration of conflict, become frequent and may lead to large international out-migration.

Maximizing and sharing the benefits of international migration requires proper regulation and policies to prevent and address the problems of informality of labour markets, upholding labour standards, avoiding the strain of social services and addressing concerns about national security. With appropriate measures in place, however, safe, orderly and regular migration can indeed support global prosperity.\",\"Continuous land fragmentation and the unprecedented growth in rural youth populations in many developing countries will exacerbate the difficulties of providing decent employment to millions of new entrants to their labour markets.

Migrants are often faced with legal, cultural and social barriers and obstacles to accessing formal housing, employment, education, health and other social services. These barriers may force them to live in conditions of exclusion, segregation and vulnerability. Migrant women, for instance, are more likely to work in low-paid, irregular, and potentially exploitive jobs, often in the informal sector.\",\"Their choice came down to: \\\"they were willing to live in congested dwellings without safety or security just so they could walk to work\\\" (Gopalan 1998)11. Other studies have found similarly very limited mobility by the urban poor. Some of the urban poor have to make a different trade-off by accepting long travel distances from a peripheral location in order to obtain affordable but secure housing. The relative immobility of the urban poor, especially poor women is a central fact in their lives and severely limits their employment options. It has already been mentioned above that the poor must trade-off the time and cost required to access livelihood opportunities against security and quality of housing.\",\"Moreover, internal and international migrations can be linked in a stepwise migration process, whereby for example an internal move towards larger cities then leads to international migration. According to Lee, in addition to push and pull factors, migration decisions are affected by a set of intervening obstacles or constraints that may prevent people from migrating or at least make migration more difficult and\\u002for costly. These decisions are subject to constraints or obstacles that may prevent people from moving, such as the cost of migrating and the distance to be travelled, among others.\",\"Affordable housing is necessary for the social integration of immigrants and for local development (Collier and Venables, 2013). Accessible transport systems help migrants to access work which in turn sparks off economic development. Investing in social inclusion strategies is necessary if migration is to pay dividends in terms of economic benefits for cities (Qlaglar, 2014). With the renewed enthusiasm among international communities and scholars to rethink cities, city mayors and urban policymakers are starting to see immigration reform in major destination countries like the United States as an urgent economic imperative for cities.\",\"Instead, policies are needed to harness the economic potential of migration and turn it to the benefit of city destinations. Migration can help increase productivity if it is strategically managed and linked to the formal economy. Fostering the inclusion of migrants into the labour market can have positive benefits for both the place of origin and of destination as links are maintained between the two. Support to migrant entrepreneurs aids not only their own socioeconomic integration but also local development.\",\"Official population data for large cities are unreliable and underestimate the real number of the urban population in large cities, because many internal and external migrants live in big cities without being officially registered (Box 1.3). This discrepancy between official demographic statistics, on the one hand, and social and demographic trends on the other, could present issues for the effective provision of public services. Since budget transfers are based on official population numbers, some large cities whose population has been underestimated may not receive enough funding for public services and to cope with the growing burden on urban infrastructure. According to the Law “On Migration”, internal migrants must register al their new place of residence.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"13_migration_migrants_internal\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"13_migration_migrants_internal\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[1.0942012,0.9916091,1.0123397,1.0204906,1.0297436,0.9437577,1.0142998,1.0829474,0.9928276,1.0081184,0.990757,1.0916972,0.9998473,1.092054,1.1287594,1.0341177,1.0492524,1.1021037,1.017985,1.115667,1.0204337,1.1533413,1.0222918,1.1192243,1.0354854,1.1322696,0.77496433,1.1730876,0.981924,0.7048197,1.134512,1.2569094,1.1302829,1.0236402,1.0048194,0.9788241,1.0983944,1.0662022,1.1073691,1.3957641,0.9829093,1.1636691,1.1338024,0.70982116,1.0481213],\"y\":[7.8495398,8.086517,8.076454,8.040805,8.143976,8.065414,7.5242057,7.854034,8.085184,8.068348,8.093465,7.8308187,8.082589,7.7844005,7.7634907,7.803972,8.006653,7.804004,8.066459,7.797723,8.070748,7.701529,8.05114,7.9621124,8.003625,7.7839203,8.121336,7.5456524,8.101224,8.497505,7.749628,7.791614,7.7434864,8.05092,7.7727337,8.124286,7.807638,7.8738713,7.830178,7.818886,8.0993,7.7297387,7.751759,8.479042,7.938408],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"A dual system of waste collection involving door-to-door and drop-off-systems should be combined in the barangays to allow for efficient collection of segregated waste based on convenience and practicality.

It now runs the first integrated resource recovery facility in the City of Naga, which handles over 130 tons of solid waste a day.\",\"At the same time, clean transport such as rail systems, ferries, E-jeepneys and shared-bike schemes need to be encouraged with the supporting infrastructure.

The constmction of this landfill also brought secondaiy benefits such as the creation of a union of scavengers that would be allowed to operate on the landfill (thereby extending the lifespan of the site). However, 6 years after its supposed closure, the site was only partially closed in 2011 and up till 2016, continued to be operational.\",\"Since urban lifestyle, resource consumption and income status are factors contributing to the rising household waste generation, targeted efforts at controlling household behaviour needs to be considered to minimise waste in this regard.

If the authorities want to promote the participation of private waste-processing companies, it needs to give them the possibility of developing profitable activities. With mandatory and prohibitory provisions and taxes, a better grade of waste processing can be enforced.

In Japan, Korea and Switzerland where a number of households are subject to the PAYT, significant positive impacts have been seen as waste generated has decreased. An OECD study indicates that PAYT reduces w'aste generation between 16% and 20% (OECD, 2014a).

Job opportunities could also figure more prominently in building energy-efficiency plans, particularly in retrofitting projects, which could potentially provide job opportunities for local residents. First, recycling rates could be increased through introducing recycling sorting bins alongside household waste collection, rather than just at collection points.\",\"Waste management and recycling policies are still relatively new. It is estimated that the valorisation rate of waste in Chile was approximately 10% in 2009 (CONAMA, 2010). The main objective of the policy is to manage solid waste in an integrated manner so as to minimise health and environmental risks while ensuring a sustainable and efficient development of the waste sector (MMA, 2011). On a national and regional level, executive secretaries (Secretarfas Ejecutiuas) were created to oversee waste management throughout the life cycle of products (creation\\u002fuse\\u002fdisposal).\",\"Instead of small-sized facilities, investments would need to be directed into an environmentally friendly large scale MRF which has a higher capacity to process waste for a given number of barangays. Consolidating the MRFs produces value for money and helps introduce technological innovation and efficiency which is not viable on small scales. Though this could temporarily create job losses for some workers in this area, these people can be shifted to other associated areas where opportunities would be created in material collection, processing and manufacturing.\",\"However, many cities are failing in proper collection and transportation as well as environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste. Uncollected waste blocks urban drainage resulting in the spread of infectious diseases. Leachate generated in uncontrolled dumpsites pollutes surface and groundwater as well as the coastal environment, Dumpsites located in coastal areas are one of the largest sources of marine litter and plastic pollution. Open dumpsites are also major source of Green House Gases (GHG).\",\"More efficient sorting and transfer stations are now being built, allowing the sorting of 100 per cent of MSW. More than 70,000 tons of secondary resources (paper, cardboard and textiles) are collected annually through the receiving centres of municipal utilities. There are now 88 waste recycling plants, which operate in all large and medium-sized cities, including Brest, Baranovichi, Gomel, Mogilev and Novopolotsk. There is a positive dynamic reflected in the increase in the share of secondary resource extraction (more than 30 per cent).\",\"The city can experiment with new' technologies at the new' landfill site planned at Gia Minh solid waste treatment complex in Thuy Nguyen district, which is 15 kilometres away from the centre and a part of the project on rain and wastewater drainage and solid waste management. Such efforts can directly improve the economic competitiveness of SMEs. Community-based action has played a key role in reducing the city’s domestic waste by setting up targets and various pilot projects that empowered identifiable groups in waste collection and sorting for recycling. For example, in Cebu, small and medium-scale businesses have identified waste treatment and recycling as a business and located a market for their end products.\",\"In June 2016, the landfill received an average of 456 tonnes of gaibage daily but by August the same year, this amount had increased to 600 tonnes. Health concerns are abound: the site has ceased operations as a sanitary landfill a long time ago and lias since become a dumpsite, and complaints from nearby residents of the stench are commonplace. The landfill lias also experienced several fires, most notably in April 2009 when the Cebu City Council declared a state of calamity in order to allocate funds to those affected by the smoke. In 2016, the Department of Environment and Natural resources (DENR) cited issued notice of violation stating Cebu City had violated 36 conditions of DENRs Environmental Compliance Certificate.\",\"During its operations, the landfill grew to a height of 70m and contained 17 million cubic metres of waste (Park Sharon, n.d.). By its final year of operation in 1998, the landfill was receiving 3 000 tons of household waste per day before the Ministry of Environmental Protection made the decision to transform the landfill site into a transfer station in 1999. The immense amount of garbage in the landfill site also attracted flocks of birds such that at one point, the birds were a hindrance to the safe landing of aitplanes landing and taking off from the nearby Ben-Gurion airport.\",\"This objective can be achieved through recycling and collection targets of the product or materials and through incentives for consumers to bring the used product back to the selling point. These include measures such as deposit-refund schemes, Advanced Disposal Fees (ADF), material taxes, and upstream combination tax\\u002fsubsidy (UCTS) that incentivise the producer to comply with EPR. In South Korea for example, ADFs are imposed on importers and producers of products that are hazardous and more difficult to recycle. Standards can be mandatory or applied by industries themselves through voluntary programmes. Measures can include imposing information requirements on producers such as reporting requirements, labelling of products and components, communicating to consumers about producer responsibility and waste separation, and informing recyclers about the materials used in products. This underscores the most pressing need to address issues of efficient management of landfill sites and other waste collection processes.\",\"Two excellent signs that African countries are taking on the challenge of waste management in urban areas include, Rwanda’s banned on the use of polyethylene bags in Africa and Ethiopia's recently-built Waste to Energy Plant at Reppie, the largest plant in Africa, which recycles 1,400 tons of waste to generate 30 per cent of energy consumed by households. The collection of solid waste in many African countries is largely performed by private services. In Bamako, Mali, for example, more than 120 microenterprises collect some 300,000 tons annually. In Lusaka, Zambia, 30 per cent of the municipal waste is collected by informal service providers (UN-Habitat, 2010).\",\"Local authorities could develop some legal framework to support the purok system and unlock some resources for its functioning. Rapid and uncontrolled uibanisation resulted in a range of environmental issues in the city by the mid-2000s, including solid waste pollution due to unsorted garbage and open waste disposal. The city also suffered from lack of clean water supply and wastewater treatment system, and periodic floods, creating critical health hazards such as dengue fever and diarrhoea. The creation of a waste bank and 24 composting houses in the city were two important measures taken by the municipality, but raising public awareness was the keystone of the programme.\",\"This deprives the LGUs of the needed funds that could have been invested on other social interventions or infrastructural developments. In Cebu City for instance, according to the city ordinance 1361 which is currently under review, garbage fees are paid quarterly and fixed for majority of businesses while some business and all residential houses are charged based on floor area. Such a measure can provide the financial resources needed for service improvement and shift the financial burden away from municipalities. Metro Cebu would need to reform its waste pricing mechanism to be better resourced to improve and expand upon its waste collection service.\",\"San Francisco (Box 2.7) is a good example of a city that has managed to divert waste to landfills by 80% in efforts to reach zero waste by the year 2020 (SF environment, 2016). Sweden is similarly a good example as only 1% of w'aste goes to landfill sites. Several jurisdictions in OECD countries such as New York City, Kamikatsu, Japan, Toronto, Canada, Seattle, Washington and New South Wales have all adopted a long-term zero waste goal.\",\"Central and Southern Asia (197 million) and sub-Saharan Africa (189 million). Data from 214 cities or municipalities in 103 countries show that about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected. In sub-Saharan Africa, less than half of all municipal solid waste generated is collected, with adverse effects on the health of residents.\",\"The following categories have been used for waste separation: biodegradable, recyclable, residual, special waste and plastics. The Cebu City ordinance 2031, introduced in 2010, provides the legislative backing for the policy. The benefit for sorting at source should enable a drastic reduction in the final quantity of residue needed to be permanently landfilled.\",\"Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) should be seen as key partners in this, as they can complement local government action to support sustainable consumption objectives. The educational campaign through innovative yet impactful messages should aim to target each demographic group and ensure effective household waste practices. Furthermore, residents can be encouraged through information outreaches to reconsider lifestyles and consumption patterns by buying eco-products or reusable items such as shopping bags.\",\"One of the main problems is that even the existence of landfills does not guarantee an adequate treatment of waste. Only between 3.9% and 6.7% of the waste that enters into the selection plants is recuperated, and the rest is deposited in landfills. Managing solid waste costs MXN 3 billion yearly (USD 185 million approximately). Mexico City has 13 transfer stations to select, store and concentrate solid waste. It also has two selection plants to separate waste that can be recycled.\",\"San Francisco has collected more than a million tons of food scraps, yard trimmings, and other compostable materials and turned it into compost that is used by local fanners and wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties.

The sharing of best practices on smart city initiatives is especially valuable in light of the global megatrends of globalisation, urbanisation, ageing population, climate change and digitalisation. Despite the fact that these megatrends impact Emerging Asian countries in different ways and that each country is at a different starting point in tackling their associated challenges, they pose risks to all cities. A range of subnational indicators are required in order to monitor how smart city initiatives impact the lives of citizens and to provide a benchmark for governments to develop even smarter cities.

As of July 2018, SCCs had already been set up in ten cities (Naya Raipur, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Pune, Nagpur, Rajkot, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, and Bhopal) and a further 13 cities had begun the process of setting up their SCCs (Hindustan Times, 2018). This design thereby grants the subnational government more responsibility, along with the associated potential difficulties and opportunities, as well as greater flexibility regarding how financing can be secured through, for instance, PPPs, user charges, multilateral funding and other taxes. In this way, such a framework provides subnational governments with a degree of flexibility in pursuing their priorities.\",\"Some cities offer final, certified exams for MOOCs which can be taken at universities in person, helping retain and motivate students throughout the learning process. Broadband and ICTs can also promote cultural diversity and enhance the creativity of urban inhabitants, which may help create a more pluralistic, tolerant and respectful environment to live in. Such a benevolent environment is key in order to nurture citizens' creativity and can catalyze innovation within the urban space7.\",\"This network comprises 116 cities with a common objective: placing creativity and cultural industries at the heart of development plans, and cooperating actively at the international level. Citizens have been empowered to engage with local government and exercise their rights and responsibilities by developing MIL skills through a range of adult literacy programmes, in particular considering the needs of vulnerable groups. A number of public Internet access points have been established. The Beijing Declaration on Building Learning Cities defines a learning city as one which: promotes inclusive learning from basic to higher education, revitalises learning in families and communities, facilitates learning for and in the workplace, extends the use of modern learning technologies, enhances quality and excellence in learning, and nurtures a culture of learning.\",\"Outside of Malacca, MIGHT has also engaged with other federal agencies in formulating smart city frameworks for different cities. In doing so, it integrates components that are designed specifically for each city, which facilitates the development of sustainable, competitive and green city models for cities across Malaysia. Government service delivery” and \\\"information communications” are two key focuses of the blueprint.\",\"For me it is a continuation of an ongoing and critical dialogue between design professionals, civic leaders, developers, and foundations from around the world, in developed and developing countries alike. The desire to exchange information openly is positive in and of itself: that we will open new networks for communication that may help solve common problems is especially positive. The previous studies have given us insights into the issues we are confronting, including challenges to both developed and developing countries.\",\"However, the 'knowledge cities' vision goes far beyond increasing efficiency. Indeed, these new digital technologies could and should help boost urban governance processes through greater inclusion and participation. This would help render education accessible to all, empower women and girls, and promote cultural diversity and creativity.\",\"However, in order to definitively assess multi-level co-ordination for smart city implementation, further follow-up is required. It requires each city to develop its own locally-tailored vision. The national government has set aside USD 7.5 billion for the Smart Cities Mission, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. While many instances of national government support to smart city development involves prescribing areas where money should be allocated, India’s Smart Cities Mission required every city that took part in the challenge to develop a vision, thereby allowing cities to play to their strengths.\",\"For instance, the purpose of the Digital Readiness Framework is to improve citizens’ quality of life. The framework documents also repeatedly identify improving digital and physical infrastructure and cybersecurity while ensuring privacy of data as key focus areas. Regarding institutional organisation, the Digital Government Blueprint describes co-ordination measures between ministries, notably through increased sharing and alignment of data between ministries as well as the appointment of Chief Digital Strategy Officers and Chief Information Officers to lead and implement digitalisation plans within their ministries and respective agencies.\",\"In March 2019, the Committee and the Digital Economy Promotion Agency convened to launch an event, “Smart City Thailand Takeoff”, which marked the country’s first open call for smart city proposals - with the definition of the application process and qualifying criteria - as well as the announcement of a new city data platform for smart city implementation with an expected launch date by the end of the year (Smart City Thailand Office, 2019). The event also established the committee’s new targets for the upcoming years: the development of 24 total smart city plans in 2019, extending to 76 by 2022. Moreover, it was announced that the Digital Economy Promotion Agency, under the supervision of the National Smart City Committee, has initiated the establishment of a national Smart City Thailand Office in Bangkok (Digital Economy Promotion Agency, 2019). With this budget, high-speed internet services with at least 1 000 Wi-Fi hotspots are planned in 100 areas in Phuket.\",\"This in turn will equip citizens with the necessary tools, skills and understanding to fully participate in their societies. To encourage the growth of learning cities and lifelong learning, UNESCO has established the Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC) encompassing one thousand cities and communities around the world (Box 1). For example, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can provide high quality education courses to wide audiences for free (although some suffer from high drop-out rates and low completion rates).\",\"Smart city strategies in Emerging Asian countries are at varying stages of advancement, with those of China and Singapore being the most comprehensive, followed by those of India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Key recent trends are discussed below. As a response, China published two national-level strategies, which lay out principles for smart city design and applications of smart technologies. These strategies were developed further in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).\",\"The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. Since the 2008 global financial crisis spurred the development of a generalised smart city concept (UNDP, 2017), a wealth of definitions of - and approaches to - smart cities has been developed and used. This chapter defines smart cities as “initiatives or approaches that effectively leverage digitalisation to boost citizen well-being and deliver more efficient, sustainable and inclusive urban services and environments as part of a collaborative, multi-stakeholder process\\\" (OECD, 2019a). Indeed, as digitalisation evolves, smart cities are increasingly viewed as unprecedented opportunities to drive economic growth and enhance citizen well-being in cities.\",\"Time will tell how an open, democratic and liberal society will protect itself from such abuses. The public governance model of ICTs should be therefore scrutinized openly and transparently in the pursuit of truly sustainable development. The reach and influence of ICTs in our individual lives are now so relevant that a whole new world of issues and topics on dealing with it will emerge.\",\"The agenda propels Thailand towards greater digitalisation, through plans such as equipping 75 000 villages with internet (digital infrastructure), digital literacy training (digital manpower) and moving towards a paperless and cashless society (digital government). Smart city strategies are highlighted under the “digital technology” component, where Thailand has identified six smart city domains (Table 2.3). Established in 2018, the committee had set and achieved a first-year target of establishing smart city action plans in seven pilot cities: Bangkok, Chachoengsao, Chiang Mai, Chon Buri, Khon Kaen, Phuket and Rayong (Tortermvasana, 2019).\",\"The three components are intended to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive smart city strategy through the participation of the government, businesses and citizens. Digital Economy: Developed in 2018, the “Digital Economy Framework for Action” sets out to guide businesses and the workforce about how to adopt digitalisation in order to keep the economy attractive through the creation of opportunities. Organised around three principles - Accelerate, Compete and Transform - the plan lays out a strategy for Singapore to become a digital economy capable of reinventing and adapting itself to change. In addition to strengthening physical and digital infrastructure, the plan details programmes for (re)training the workforce as well as adapting policies, regulations and standards in a manner that intends to strike a balance between making Singapore competitive and protecting the public interest.\",\"If countries overlook the soft components of the ICT roll-out such as skills, education, local content, inclusive policies, participation and institutional accountability, the impacts of the digital revolution will fall short. In the spirit of inclusive knowledge cities, broadband infrastructure and soft-components need to be conceived and rolled out jointly, to ensure a future human-centred, sustainable city development. Although automation may lead to loss of jobs, smart and knowledge cities will lead to the creation of jobs in IT, data analysis, research and in the socio-cultural and environmental sectors.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"15_smart_digital_city\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"15_smart_digital_city\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[-0.36934784,0.16720782,0.09623005,0.1524744,0.07994653,0.18174657,-0.04336863,0.10038907,-0.04116481,0.12620844,0.22682053,0.16053863,0.12202729,0.097894415,-0.22962008,-0.28001484,0.17436758,-0.23490539,-0.20882577,0.16677223,0.06620741,0.18613352,-0.30784586,0.19224878,0.14166676,-0.036902886,0.16194864,0.093117304,-0.02322795,0.031680066],\"y\":[3.507827,2.5971582,2.6706,2.7759955,2.723066,2.615066,2.955269,2.6899104,2.9247482,2.6335754,2.5760324,2.6344476,2.6582415,2.6976483,3.164211,3.218178,2.6074305,3.1913023,3.1669474,2.6115127,2.7026877,2.5810149,3.204271,2.5992138,2.6473563,2.9356341,2.6210618,2.676188,2.8886197,2.80949],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"Since 1970, the tax base is common to property tax on developed land, property tax on undeveloped land and the residence tax (cadastral income). During the past twenty past years, the economic contribution has been reformed to encourage investment. It also creates an incentive to attract new residents and businesses in order to expand the tax base.\",\"On the one hand, if the tax is shifted on to consumers, house prices increase, increasing the demand for smaller housing units and thereby population density. On the other hand, the property tax can promote urban sprawl as it reduces the capital-land ratio and thereby the number of housing units per unit of land area and density. A proposal being discussed in Germany is a land-use tax, which would differentiate land tax rates depending on how land is used and the associated environmental costs.\",\"Designed well, property taxes can be used as an effective tool for sustainable land use (Box 1.10). The tax base is the cadastral income, equal to 50% of the notional rental value regularly updated by the authorities. The amount of tax is calculated by multiplying the tax base by the rates voted by each beneficiaiy local authority for the year in question.\",\"However, since then, it has become increasingly common for municipalities and developers to jointly undertake the land servicing with the developers paying the infrastructure costs. In such cases, the (extra) infrastructure costs need to be subsidised. The costs of providing serviced building plots on the brownfields are usually far higher than on greenfield locations. Much is done to keep the losses small by, for example, encouraging high-density development and multiple commercial uses.\",\"To achieve this, tax incentives and other assistance such as dereliction aid and gap funding schemes are provided to eliminate barriers for brownfield development. In the US, the Brownfield Act of 2002 sets out the arrangement for providing economic incentives and liability exemptions to developers in Brownfield sites. Prior to the enactment of the Brownfield Act, the federal government, through the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), mobilised tax revenues from chemical and petroleum industries, which went to a trust fund (commonly known as Superfund) for cleaning up abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.\",\"The amount of tax is calculated by multiplying the cadastral income of each property by the rates voted by each beneficiary local authority for the year in question. For residential premises used as the taxpayer's main home, compulsory relief for dependents or optional relief (general relief on the base, special relief on the base, relief for disabled people) is deducted from the notional rental value. The amount of tax is calculated by multiplying the income from the tax base by the rates voted by each beneficiary commune or public establishment for intercommunal co-operation for the year in question.\",\"The total own-source tax revenues (OZB-propertv tax, sewage and waste and other taxes) are less than 8%. At the same time, local governments are stimulated to provide services in a cost-efficient manner to make the most of allotted transfers. For land-use policy, Dutch municipalities have less pressure to increase owm-source revenues, including the property tax.\",\"Therefore, if the city of Amsterdam were to increase its rates, this would have consequences for other cities, the macro-standard and for the contribution that they receive from the municipal fund. Considered less distortonary, more progressive and efficient than the composed property tax (land + building) and the tax on commercial activities or labour. One-time tax, levy or charge imposed on landowners adjacent to public infrastructure investment that would have contributed to land valorization. “\",\"Until the mid-1990s, it was common that all developments of more than half a hectare took place on land w'hich was provided, and serviced, by the municipality. The municipality would acquire the land in advance at less than development value, prepare and service it, and divide it into serviced building plots. By selling land lease contracts on those plots, the municipality covered its costs and developers (including schools and housing associations) bore the infrastructure costs.\",\"Thus, a land value tax provides strong incentives to develop uiban brownfield sites. In contrast, under a general property tax that considers the value of the building and the land together, the owner of the brownfield site would have to pay much lower taxes than the owner of the plot with the skyscraper and consequently, would have less incentives to develop the land. They create a mechanism through which land owners compensate the public for the costs that they impose on the public by developing land in particular ways.\",\"Governments should tackle such perverse incentives through adequate land-use planning instruments: local government should address local land-use externalities, and upper-level government should address externalities with a wider geographical reach. For example, local governments in the United States count numerous property tax incentives for raising energy efficiency and renewable energy use. The Czech Republic, Italy, Norway and Spain are further examples of countries that provide property tax relief for renewable energy installations. The efficiency and effectiveness of these property tax rebates would have to be weighed against their costs in terms of a narrower property tax base and less tax revenue.\",\"In Amsterdam, own-source revenues are increasingly important. For example, national operational subsidies for public transport are declining, which is placing pressure on the city to both establish a more cost-effective transit system and cover operational costs in the interim. It bears noting that water boards are in a much better fiscal situation given that they can raise taxes to cover their programme needs.\",\"This also contributes to urban sprawl. Presently, the property tax on developed land generates the largest share of revenue followed by the residence tax, the value-added tax on business income, the tax on business premises and finally, the tax on underdeveloped land. There are many other fiscal instruments that could be drawn on in order to complement spatial development objectives (Table 1.2).\",\"The city determines a ground lease for 75 years (as it was in the 19th century), or 50 years (the system as it is now) or eternally (as of 2016). Upon land (re)development, the city sets an annual ground lease (set for given timeframe), or determines a lump-sum payment-at-once (as is the discounted sum of annual ground lease over the given timeframe, with a possible discount). After those 75 or 50 years, the city sets a new ground lease according to the then-applicable ground lease system rules. In doing so, it is able to capture the increase in land value and use it to further public investments that benefit residents.\",\"The basis for assessing the property tax on undeveloped land is 80% of the notional rental value of the property resulting from valuations regularly updated by the authorities. To encourage owners to put their land up for sale in order to increase the volume of buildable lots, an increase in the notional rental value of buildable lots is applied in zones w here real estate pressures are the strongest. Agricultural lands, including those left fallow, are exempt from any increase.\",\"Financing for this remediation is not readily available from government and private local property developers are reluctant to undertake this function. At the moment, there is no systematic planning, nor serious anticipation regarding the potential for brownfield redevelopments, even though a number of initiatives to encourage new housing construction have been launched. One strategy to begin the transformation of brown-field sties is to encourage temporary uses in order to increase interest in the area and demonstrate its potential vitality (Box 2.6). The first is the cost of reconversion.\",\"Accordingly, the city has looked to value capture strategies to render these measures cost-effective. One advantage has been the continuing rise in commercial property values, which has greatly enhanced the value of TfL’s own real estate holdings. In addition, the rising trend has enabled the city to use a supplement to an existing property tax on commercial buildings as a powerful value capture mechanism.\",\"For example, in the United States, a federal brownfield tax incentive was introduced in 1997 which entailed fully tax deductible environmental clean-up costs, including petroleum cleanup. This programme was sunsetted in 2011. Meanwhile, examples from cities abound - for instance, New Yoik City offers grants to property owners and developers to clean up and redevelop brownfields.\",\"Reducing the regulatory burden and streamlining permits and other administrative procedures can be a relatively inexpensive way to promote the development of brownfield areas. City governments, with the support of oblast and central governments, can promote the redevelopment of brow nfields in a number of ways, beginning with a “fast-track” type of streamlined and simplified permitting system for projects on brownfield land, as a minimal intervention approach. However, it is necessary to manage the redevelopment of former industrial zones, because concerns over environmental conditions may emerge. An expedited and simplified review was implemented in Germany due to concerns over urban sprawl in the 1990s. A number of initiatives were instituted to promote a higher intensity of land use, including a simplified set of planning rules for infill development as part of the Research for the Reduction of Land Consumption and for Sustainable Land Management (REFINA) initiative, which began in the mid-2000s.\",\"Replacing a traditional property tax with a land-value tax, or a split-value tax that includes higher rates for land value and lower rates for structures or other improvements (as implemented by some municipalities in the US state of Pennsylvania), could encourage development in the urban core. A development charge is a one-off levy on developers to finance the growth-related capital costs associated with new development or, in some cases, redevelopment. These charges are levied on works constructed by the municipality, and the funds collected must finance the infrastructure needed for the development.\",\"Municipalities often grant exemptions from the “territorial economic contribution”, a local property and value-added tax paid by businesses, in order to attract jobs (OECD, 2015b: 39). In doing so, they often encourage investment in suburban or peri-urban locales, which is contrary to spatial development objectives. Finally, local governments also make too little use of their power to modulate taxes on new low-density construction, while a number of measures to ease property access give undue encouragement to new construction at the expense of renovations (OECD, 2015: 39).\",\"Further, they need to be carefully designed so that individuals cannot “game the system” by, for example, misrepresenting the true use of a property. Designing property taxes and charges to tackle urban sprawl (cont.) Perverse incentives are created when single-family residential properties are offered lower taxes than higher-density properties of the same value (Haveman and Sexton, 2008). When property taxes are based on land value, rather than buildings or other improvements to the property, owners have an incentive to develop the land to its most profitable use.\",\"Thus, lower property taxes need to be paid on them, which encourages low density development and horizontal expansion of cities (Brueckner and Kim, 2003). At the same time, property taxes make housing floor space more expensive, which makes households use less housing. If the ratio of land relative to dwelling size remains constant, this reduces land consumption and contributes to more compact patterns of development (Song and Zenou, 2006).\",\"Generally, accessing property is a tedious and difficult process that necessitates engaging with corrupt and procedure-heavy bureaucracies and paying multiple fees. High land values in the sub-region have stimulated land speculation. This, in turn, reduces the means available for the upgrading of public services. Accurately compiled and updated data on housing settlements are deficient in the absence of formal systems, hence efficient municipal tax collection is virtually impossible.\",\"One of the most obvious examples is how tax policies affect land use is the tax deductibility of commuting expenses. Commuting expenses are tax deductible in 12 of 26 analysed OECD countries (Harding, 2014). Given the marginal tax rates in OECD countries, this reduces the costs of commuting by up to 50%, which provides incentives to people to live further away from their place of work than they would otherwise.\",\"Singapore promised revenue neutrality by reducing vehicle taxes, while the Dutch proposed to replace vehicle ownership-based charges with usage-based charges (ITF, 2010). An increasing number of municipalities have replaced taxes on the value of buildings with taxes on the value of land sites, resulting in a decoupling of land value from the value of real estate improvements (Cohen and Coughlin, 2005). With the most famous example in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) (Oates and Schwab, 1997), nowadays more than 700 cities worldwide use a “two-rate\\\" taxation system, whereby the majority of property values is represented by land, whose value is often increased as a result of public investments in the surrounding area (e.g. attractive neighbourhoods and services).\",\"In Germany, impact fees can, for example, be charged on entire neighbourhoods that benefited from rehabilitation measures that are not necessarily related to particular plots. As such, these fees have characteristics that are in many respects similar to betterment levies. Org\\u002f10.1016\\u002fi.regsciuibeco.2004.05.004: De Sousa, C.A, C. Wu and L.M.

Part of the explanation for this is that Amsterdam gains revenues from its ground lease system. In the financial statements from Amsterdam over 2015, the total net revenues from ground leases were EUR 236 million (Amsterdam, 2015).

Total consolidated revenues for 2016 are expected to be CAD $1.4 billion on a funded basis. The RGS’ objectives are to co-ordinate action on housing, transport, infrastructure and economic development in recognition that collaboration at regional level will make individual municipal action more effective.\",\"As previously discussed, the MCDA is in a good position to minimise such co-ordination challenges, as it will be in charge of both transport and overall sustainable development plans for Metro Cebu. However, the fact that LGUs remain to be responsible for their land use plans (CLUPs) underscores the need for effective co-ordination on spatial development. Metro Vancouver provides regional services, including three core utilities (water, liquid waste, solid waste), and co-ordinates regional planning by producing the Regional Growth Strategy (RGS).\",\"Tw'O major benefits can be reaped from this. Firstly, LGU’s in Metro Cebu could use land value capture tools to raise revenue from the direct and indirect benefits generated by the BRT to finance urban transport expansion. Land value capture enables the mobilisation for the benefit of the community the land value increments generated by the actions of others besides the landowner (Smolka, 2016).\",\"Total LGU spending increased from an average of 1.6% of GDP during 1985-91 to about 3% in the late 2000s, against 16.6% of GDP in the OECD area in 2015 (OECD, 2015b). While the central governments still undertake major “hard” public infrastructure investment (e.g. major roads, ports, airports), LGUs nonetheless have substantial expenditure responsibilities, for instance in the environment sector (e.g. solid waste disposal, water supply systems, seawalls and dikes, drainage and sewerage, flood control) (Department of Finance, 2015). However, LGUs have very limited ambitions for funding infrastructure development (OECD, 2015). In Metro Cebu, total expenditures reached around PHP 8.7 billion in 2014 (83.7% of total revenues), most of expenditures went for general public services (54% of total expenditures), follow'ed by social services (22.7%) and economic services (16.7%).\",\"The Local Government Units Public Financial Management (LGU PFM) Reform Roadmap and Implementation Strategy, an initiative launched by the national government in 2015, could consider this particular topic. Given the horizontal fragmentation of LGUs in Metro Cebu and the need to develop infrastructure across the whole metropolitan area (e.g. water, transport), this is a critical obstacle to finance urban green growth. The Board should be entitled to borrow from banks and on markets to make the necessary investment to carry out the functions devolved by the Local Government Code. By legislation, Metro Vancouver districts are required to operate balanced budgets and any deficit must be repaid immediately the follow ing year.\",\"Only 1.4% of total lending by 29 major banks in Indonesia was considered to be “green” in 2013, according to a Bank Indonesia survey (UNEP, 2015).9 This accounted for about USD 1 billion. The 2014 Asia Sustainability Investment Review estimated that sustainable investments in Indonesia’s capital markets totalled USD 1.14 billion at the end of 2013 (UNEP, 2015). This is low in comparison to total banking activities, but not negligible.\",\"They can, upon attaining certain requirements, including a minimum population size and annual revenue, opt to become a city. Cebu Province comprises 44 municipalities. Finally, municipalities and cities are composed of barangays, the smallest independently elected LGUs, there are over 42 000 throughout the Philippines and 1 096 in the Province of Cebu alone. Metro Cebu, specifically, is composed of 13 LGUs in total, including three independent cities, four component cities and six municipalities.\",\"A harmonised definition of urban areas as “functional economic units” would be useful in designing and implementing green growth strategies according to functionally integrated areas, rather than administrative entities. It w'ould also increase comparability of metropolitan areas, and therefore Metro Cebu can learn draw' positive lessons from best practices in other FUAs, thereby encouraging more effective coordination. Smart city solutions may also help to create more channels for governance linkages between LGUs.\",\"Each utility generates revenues via user pay that reflect the costs of managing the infrastmcture in the region. Drinking water supply, sewerage and management of solid waste represent the majority of both operating and capital budgets, and are financed through utility fees. Property taxes account for a small portion of the regional budget, and support the Regional Parks system, as well as other services including Air Quality Management and Regional Planning activities. The Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation is financed almost entirely through rents paid by tenants. The budget represents a CAD 427 annual cost to the average regional household. While the fiscal mandate of LGUs was broadened by the Local Government Code 1991 to include revenue assignments, devolvement of expenditure responsibilities, intergovernmental transfers, and subnational debt\\u002fcredit financing (Department of Finance, 2015), fiscal decentralisation has been limited in practice and authority and resources remain highly centralised: the proportion of total tax revenue collected by LGUs in the Philippines remains low at around 5.2% in 2013, and has not evolved since 2000.\",\"Many urban governments still depend to a very large extent on fiscal transfers. In Indonesia, the General Allocation Fund and the Special Allocation Fund accounted for 51% and 5%, respectively, of regencies’ and cities’ revenues in 2015. In this regard, central governments could earmark special funds for green growth-related activities.\",\"Fuel quality standards, which are in use across the region, may raise fuel prices in addition to the typical goal of reducing pollution. By region, average household expenditure on transportation varied between 9.3% and 15.9% of non-food expenditure, with between 45.3% and 57.8% of this is spent on fuel, among households owning cars (Figure 2.10). As a share of nonfood expenditure, average household transport expenditure was the highest in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), Cordillera Administrative Region and Northern Mindanao.\",\"There are opportunities to further raise ow n revenue, in particular tariffs and user charges. Attracting private investment should also be emphasised: FDI inflows have been lower in the Philippines than in other countries of the Southeast Asian region, in particular because of the strong restrictiveness imposed by the central government. Opportunities also lie in Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) which are currently encouraged at the subnational level through the PPP Centre of NEDA, however, the impact of such initiative is not yet visible in Cebu.\",\"Around PHP 0.9 billion were spent in capital investment in Metro Cebu, which accounts for 9.8% of total revenues in the metropolitan area. On average, capital investment account for 13.2% of local governments’ expenditures in OECD countries (OECD, 2016b). In 2013, total tax revenues only represented 16.2% of the Philippines’s GDP, while this share is around 34% on average in OECD countries (OECD, 2015c). The inability of LGUs to collect taxes efficiently, in particular, has been pointed out by the LGU Tax Watch, an initiative of the Department of Finance and the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\",\"This has resulted in many isolated initiatives and policies in critical sectors for green growth that have not addressed the metropolitan size of urbanisation and growth in Metro Cebu, and also in incoherence and management failures due to inconsistent policies across jurisdictions. The BRT is only being designed and implemented in Cebu City. Even though Cebu City is the largest LGU of the metropolitan area, Metro Cebu would benefit much more from a bus network that reaches out to adjacent LGUs, as many residents commute from these areas to Cebu City, or vice-versa.\",\"In Bandung City, 44% of total revenue in 2016 is expected to come in the form of transfers from the national government. A common problem w'ith such automatic transfers is the way they are calculated. The General Allocation Fund is partly allocated based on the registered population in the local governments and does not take into account unregistered population, which is high in the City of Bandung.\",\"Progressively, MCDA should be granted increasing fiscal authority on numerous matters that require metropolitan management, in particular mobility, solid w aste and water management. Giving more weight to MCDA in managing finance in Metro Cebu could also help to ease the negative effects of revenue inequalities as show'n in Figure 4.2. As an example, Metro Vancouver’s revenues are mostly built through water sales (37%), sewer levy (29%) and solid w'aste tipping fee (12%) (Box 4.3). Similarly, 43% of Barcelona Metropolitan Authority’s (AMA) budget - at around EUROS 280 million - are built through the waste management tax and the mobility tax, and 13% from PPPs for w'ater supply and night bus service.\",\"Finally, it provides input to the Mayors' Council on proposed borrowing limit increases in ten-year transport investment plans. It aims for solid waste volume reduction, better resource conservation and recovery, prohibits certain actions and products, provides penalties and appropriates funds. Despite the comprehensive policy framework, LGUs are struggling to implement the policy.\",\"The 2040 Growth Concept emphasises co-ordination of land use and transport in order to preserve the region’s locational advantage as a relatively uncongested hub for trade. It also states that the preferred form of regional growth is to contain growth within a carefully managed urban growth boundary' (UGB), a land-use planning line to protect farms and forests from urban sprawl and orient growth in the form of infill and redevelopment with higher density where it is appropriate. The UGB has been expanded more than 30 times since it was first drawn up, in accordance with forecasts of land supply needs. In its quality as an MPO, Metro is also tasked with preparing a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which evaluates federal, state and local funding for transport improvements, estimates project costs and proposes funding strategies.\",\"In this regard, the MCDA should be able to sign PPP contract, involving several LGUs of Metro Cebu. In the future, it will be critical to develop PPP projects in green growth opportunity areas that will spread over or involve multiple jurisdictions (BRT, metro system, drainage and recycling facilities etc.). Likewise, by comprising big cities such Cebu City and smaller municipalities, the establishment of MCDA should help to integrate municipalities with lower tax authority and borrowing capacities into metropolitan projects with the private sector.\",\"Metro Vancouver provides regional services, including three core utilities (water, liquid waste, solid waste), and co-ordinates regional planning by producing the Regional Growth Strategy (RGS). There is a separate metropolitan public transport authority called TransLink, which was created in 1998 and is responsible for setting and administrating fares for regional public transport services. Metro Vancouver is responsible for formulating the RGS and regional air quality objectives that TransLink must consider when developing long-term transport strategies.\",\"In comparison, revenues per inhabitant in Davao City, Quezon City and Makati City were of USD 210, USD 318 and USD 1 229, respectively (Department of Finance website). Revenues in Metro Cebu are also low relatively to standards of other major Southeast Asian cities: in terms of purchasing-power-parities, the City of Bangkok for instance benefitted in 2012 from revenues estimated at around USD 1 075 per inhabitant, the City of Bandung from revenues at around USD 653 in 2016 and the City of Hai Phong from revenues at around USD 3 340 in 2014 (OECD, 2015, 2016a, 2016b). From 2009 to 2014, in Region VII, provinces’ revenues have increased from PHP 4.4 billion to PHP 6 billion, cities’ revenues have increased from PHP 9.1 billion to PHP 14 billion, and municipalities’ revenues have increased from PHP 7.3 billion to PHP 9.7 billion. In Metro Cebu, total revenues have increased from PHP 8.3 billion in 2012 to PHP 10.4 billion in 2014.\",\"Independent cities have much wider tax collection authority than component cities and municipalities, which are much more dependent on transfers from the national and provincial governments. For instance, independent cities collect and retain their own property tax, while municipalities only get a share of the property tax which is collected by the provincial government. Revenues of the provincial government of Cebu are also strongly constituted by the IRA, at around 80%, while locally-raised revenues account for 18% of its total revenues (Department of Finance website).

Source: Department of Finance website.\",\"Metro Cebu facilitating dialogue and collaboration among industries could serve as an opportunity for business leaders to discover synergistic possibilities and potential exchanges that could fuel the symbiotic networks. It is therefore important that Metro Cebu continues the support to industries through policies aimed at skill development, green procurements, environmental technology diffusion, innovation hubs, and economic incentives. Rather than being the result of a carefully planned process, the eco-park developed gradually through co-operation by a number of neighbouring industrial companies.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"17_cebu_metro_revenues\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"17_cebu_metro_revenues\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[0.33522624,0.23510005,0.39944544,0.37190163,0.29123512,0.24131182,0.38746843,0.4450937,0.41009665,0.25283498,0.5532773,0.21075499,0.41133237,0.42852455,0.28651074,0.34755936,0.35663766,0.5791794,0.20185044,0.29807684,0.41041753,0.4030261,0.59868574,0.36763245],\"y\":[4.267193,4.3032875,4.3060894,3.9410398,4.0538383,3.787689,4.0476866,4.217732,3.9939582,3.806701,3.957692,4.057783,3.9770882,4.1986194,3.9170663,4.015693,4.0885134,5.4557014,4.177853,4.3757806,3.9667227,3.9890342,4.1170936,4.131298],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"New EZs and ICs are also planned to the north and south-east of the traditional urban core in several satellite areas.

Such exchange may be most efficient if foreign and domestic firms, as w'ell as large and small firms, can interact with each other.\",\"According to the Energy Conservation and Cleaner Production Centre of Hai Phong City (ECC), the energy audit activities have saved a total of 50.3 million kWh per year, equivalent in monetary terms to more than USD 3.03 million (VDN 64 billion) and a reduction in carbon emissions of 42 000 tons per year (ECCH, 2014a). To accelerate these efforts, the city could consider providing technical guidance and financial support to all small and medium-sized manufacturing industries in the city. For example, the city could send experts who provide technical advice to these firms and finance a part of the costs of high-energy-efficiency production facilities. The experience of Kitakyushu, Japan, suggests that process conversion and end-of-pipe (EP) technologies can achieve a significant reduction in pollution, and that decisive action by the city w'as a critical factor in its success (Box 2.1).\",\"Currently, across the Philippines and in Cebu many efforts are being made such as the Cebu Unplugged Campaign of the Visayan Electric Company (VECO, 2015). This awareness drive does not only focus on teaching practical energy conservation measures but also touches on water conservation as well, which is a prudent policy complementarity approach. Areas that can be strengthened include provision of information on labelling of appliance’s energy efficiency to consumers.\",\"The geothermal energy is sourced from outside the Cebu province and is supplied by the Tongonan Geothermal power plant, in Leyte through submarines cables. Thanks to that, geothermal accounts for 46.40% of power supply. Hydro power for Cebu is sourced from three facilities located in the western side of Cebu Island (0.50MW Mantavupan Hydroelectric Power Plant in Barili, 0.50 MW Basak 1 Hydroelectric Power Plant and 0.750 MW Matutinao Hydroelectric Power Plant in Badian).\",\"In 2013, environmentally-related taxes accounted for 13.7% of total tax revenue in India and 7.3% in China, but only 1.4% in Malaysia and 1.3% in the Philippines.2 A new law in China that came into effect at the beginning of 2018 introduced new taxes on polluters. It will likely affect these rates in future, although its main purpose is not to raise revenue. For example, the building sector - including space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, appliances and cooking equipment in residential, commercial and industrial buildings - accounts for 55% of anthropogenic emissions of fine particulate matter, 5% of all nitrogen oxide emissions and 7% of sulphur dioxide emissions globally (IEA, 2016). Reducing emissions from this sector requires replacing kerosene lighting with electricity, and improving access to clean cooking facilities.\",\"The sewage treatment fee is relatively low (only 15% of the clean water price) (City of Hai Phong, 2015). Waste collection service covers all urban districts and approximately 90% of rural districts in the city. The Department of Construction (DOC) is in charge of domestic waste in urban areas, and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is in charge of domestic waste in rural areas. The volume of urban waste per person per day generated in Hai Phong has increased from 0.7 kg in early 2000’s to 1.3 kg in 2015.\",\"In Hai Phong, for example, annual waste generated in 2025 is expected to be quadruple the levels produced by the city in 2015 (OECD, 2016b). It includes specific targets for the collection and treatment of solid waste in urban and rural areas for industrial, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, tow'ards 2015, 2020, and 2025. For example, by 2020, 90% of municipal solid waste is to be collected and treated in all cities and 85% of the collected waste is to be recycled, reused or used for energy recovery and organic fertiliser production.\",\"By 2014, 17 automated mini-CHP stations utilizing domestic fuels had been built. A number of incentives have been used to promote these initiatives. These include “green tariffs”, also known as feed-in tariffs (a multiplier of 1.3 to the tariff for green electricity production for a 10 year period (chapter 3)) and tax concessions for investors.\",\"A considerable number of fossil fuel power plants are located near large cities in Emerging Asia (Table 3.4). In terms of total annual generation, the 27 coal plants near Shanghai produce an estimated 161 519.1 GWh per year, while Bangkok is highly exposed to gas-fired generation, 17 plants near the city produce an estimated 83 039.9 GWh. The countries in the region with coal-fired power generation (i.e. all except Brunei Darussalam) have established emissions standards for particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides.\",\"That notwithstanding, the country also plans to strongly pursue a renewable energy drive which in 2015 accounted for 25% of gross power generation. In terms of percentage of renewable energy as percentage share of total primary energy supply, the Philippines has the highest rate (38%) compared to other Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia (3%), Thailand (20%), Viet Nam (31%) and even the OECD average of (10%) (Figure 2.4). The law envisages reductions in GHG emission while promoting economic growth, protecting health and safeguarding the environment.\",\"The energy supply is apparently still keeping up with increasing energy demand. The current capacity in 2015 in Hai Phong was about 3 670 million kWh, whereas the actual demand is around 2 130 million kWh (the surplus can be sold commercially). Demand, however, is expected to increase by 13.7% (2016-20).\",\"In Hai Phong, w'ater-quality monitoring has been conducted since 2006 in channels, lakes, estuaries and rivers of the Re River, Gia River and Da Do River. However, the number of parameters covered and the frequency is not sufficient, given the limited city budget (City of Hai Phong, 2015). In addition, to strengthen pollution source control with industry, the city should invest in installing real-time monitoring stations in major water systems and make the data available to the public. The sewer system of Hai Phong City, which is similar to other systems in urban areas across the country, is a tributary drainage system in which rainw'ater and w'astewater flow through the same system.\",\"This action plan aims to green urban areas, green industry, green the environment and transform Hai Phong into a “green port city”, by taking advantage of the historical port city and setting up a modem, competitive and eco-friendly green port system. In 2015, the city also produced the Green Growth Promotion Plan to identify tangible projects to implement the Action Plan. It is also indispensable for Hai Phong to formulate a mobility master plan to supplement the city master plan and guide the city to transit-oriented development.\",\"Iskandar Malaysia’s Green Economy Guidelines (GEG) manuals are another promising tool for facilitating green growth in the private sector. The manuals cover a wide range of green actions, such as procurement, operations and supply chain management (Box 2.2). The iron and steel industiy further reduced SO* and other emissions in response to more stringent local pollution monitoring and controls and increasing pressure from the public. The pollution reduction through energy conservation accounted for 33% of the total reduction, the second-largest contribution after the energy’ supply shift (phasing out coal power plants).\",\"The city is also implementing pilot projects using solar batteries for public lighting and traffic lights (City of Hai Phong, 2015). Based on assessments of the pilot projects, these initiatives could be scaled up. Given that Hai Phong sends most domestic solid waste to landfill, modem incinerators with emissions control technology could significantly reduce emissions (Pyper, 2011). However, the development of a mechanism of waste separation would be a prerequisite for effective operation.\",\"While the national government is responsible for structural energy policies to transform the energy mix by creating a market environment in favour of cleaner energy sources, large cities like Hai Phong can contribute to national goals by piloting renewable energy options, promoting greener products and energy efficient buildings, in addition to improving energy efficiency in industry. Many local energy policies can create co-benefits, such as reduced air pollution and improved traffic congestion, which correlate effectively with local actions. To increase the proportion of its energy sourced from sustainable sources, use of biomass electricity is expected to rise from 0.6% in 2020 to 1.1% in 2030 (City of Hai Phong, 2015).\",\"Hai Phong should improve solid waste management in two ways: minimise damage to the local environment and public health, while making the most of the potential for growth. Major industrial waste includes: i) vamish products (paint, varnish, enamel glass), adhesives, sealants and printing inks, ii) waste oil, waste from liquid fuel, organic solvent waste, refrigerants and propellants, and iii) packing waste, sorbent, rags, filter materials, protective fabrics. In Hai Phong’s industrial zones, such as Nomura, Dinh Vu, Trang Due, south of Kien Bridge and Do Sonthese, industrial waste is collected and treated (mostly by burning, while gas and oils are recycled) by five private companies.\",\"The central government should urgently pursue its roadmap to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, as laid down in the 2012 National Green Growth Strategy (NGGS). The practice varies widely in different countries. In Thailand, a green-label programme introduced by the national government for consumers and industrial products has been awarded to over 500 products (OECD, 2015a).\",\"At the national level, the central government has standards, targets and a programme (Master Plan 7) to increase energy efficiency in manufacturing. At the city level, the Hai Phong Green Growth Strategy for Industry in 2020 (with the target for 2030) formulates a vision for modernising industry and encourages energy-effective production. Based on this plan, the city will help the 120 casting companies that use coal to transform their manufacturing process. The city is already supporting firms in energy auditing and has provided consulting solutions to save energy.\",\"In hot climates, low'-cost solutions such as reflective roofs and walls, exterior shades, and low'-emissivity window' coatings and films can significantly reduce energy consumption for cooling (IEA, 2013). National and local government institutions, with technical assistance from university and research institutions, could support research on passive cooling designs, and provide vocational training for a new generation of installation technicians and technical assistance for contractors and construction companies. This is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of all the policy instruments. Such a training programme could also can increase job opportunities and promote green growth.

In 2001, a communaute de communes was organised around the city of Nantes and a political campaign was launched by the president of the Nantes metropole to promote the idea of joint governance for a larger area that would involve all the communes around the boundaries of the Nantes metropole. Eventually this culture of working together led to the decision to develop the first SCoT (Schema de Coherence Territoriale) as a mechanism to allow more co-ordinated spatial development planning and plan implementation. Satisfaction with the outcomes of this very intense period of collaboration and joint reflection led to the next decision to increase the degree of integration by creating the Nantes Saint-Nazaire metropole, which was launched in 2012.\",\"The commune of Nantes is the 6th largest city in France, with a population of about 900 000, while the commune of Saint-Nazaire has a population of about 70 000. A period of intense economic decline in the 1980s sparked a common need for the two cities to collaborate more effectively.1 During this time local authorities worked to develop a common agenda for the Nantes Saint-Nazaire area in order to better compete for investment and residents against other French territories. To foster this culture of partnership, the Pole metropolitain was established, which, together with large scale private investment, has played a major role in reversing the area’s fortunes to make it an attractive place for residents and businesses (Figure 3.2). The Nantes FUA encompasses 108 communes while Saint-Nazaire’s is much smaller, with only 35 communes.\",\"Where local government are responsible for a greater share of own source revenues, they face a distinct pressures to increase their local tax bases. Depending on the nature of local taxation, this can lead to a push for residential expansion in order to increase the amount of property taxes available to a municipality, or attracting businesses to the area in order to increase business tax contributions. Both Nantes and Saint-Nazaire are increasingly relying on own source revenues to fund operating expenditures. In Nantes, the contribution of local taxes to total operating expenditures between 2009 and 2014 increased by 16% while in Saint-Nazaire it increased by 22% (Figure 3.9).\",\"Being able to walk to a restaurant or a grocery store is a key benefit from living in a mixed use urban neighbourhood, as is having a home in a rural commune next to a forest preserve. This suggests that a key challenge for land use plans is not simply to apply exclusionary zoning that separates different uses, but to identify which uses are compatible with each other and support those, while discouraging those that conflict from being in close proximity. They are fond of different dimensions that can only partly be fulfilled in the city: natural areas, recreation areas, nearby farms and locally produced food that is authentic to the region In Nantes Saint-Nazaire, this desire for both nature and preserved, but transformed, landscapes, is particularly strong.\",\"The benefits of this are: reduced infrastructure costs, the potential for less car use for commuting if people live near where they w'ork and preserving land for agriculture and nature. To maintain support for the plan’s objectives, the two core communes may have to compensate these losing communes, w'hich of course reduces the benefits of the strategy. Moreover, the spatial strategy seems to assume that new employers will be w illing to settle for a higher cost and more complex to develop browmfield sites in Nantes or Saint-Nazaire over greenfield sites in a rural commune.\",\"It is recognised that there are many ways to depict well-being. The OECD’s work in this area is specifically structured to facilitate comparative analysis between regions. Eighty per cent of the territory is composed of natural and agricultural areas, 23% of the territory of the Nantes Saint-Nazaire metropole is covered by wetlands and approximately 2 800 km of rivers.\",\"The Pole Metropolitain Nantes Saint-Nazaire also has its own budget which consists of contributions from intercommunalites which is calculated by taking into account the weight of population in the cluster and its tax wealth. However, its situation is not due to exceptional circumstances. What separates the metropole from similar areas is its level of development, and not the particular character of the local mi leu.\",\"For Saint-Nazaire, one can expect slight changes in this respect, given the new contracts signed by the shipyard for the construction of several big cruise ships, but these largely protect current jobs and do not offer large net increases in direct employment. Further, it is important to consider that the 2008 economic crisis would have negatively impacted economic development in the intervening years. There is now a strong focus on improving interaction and dialogue both between the two urban areas in the estuary, and also among the two urban areas and the more rural communes.\",\"Nevertheless, they raise questions in terms of action co-ordination and coherence. The previous SCoTl was built on the basis of local PLUs and POSs. But now there is a need for greater congruence between the orientation of the new SCoT and the next generation of PLUs, especially the PLUm of the Nantes metropole.\",\"Even before the most recent round of planning reforms put in place by the French government that now require better co-ordination of planning, local governments in this region took advantage of earlier legislation that allowed the formation of intercommunal organisations to facilitate co-operative activities including land use planning. Managing the Loire estuary and local streams and wetlands cannot be done on a commune by commune basis, and this common issue provided an early impetus for collaboration. Similarly, historical competition between Nantes and Saint-Nazaire over shipyards and port facilities evolved into co-operation when both places were forced to come together in order to build a more efficient port complex that could compete with other port cities in Europe. Thus, the governance and regulation of land use are as much a political project as they are a reaction to social, economic conditions and urban-rural morphologies. The preceding discussions of the area’s spatial planning objectives illuminate several major challenges and opportunities. These are discussed in turn.\",\"Shipbuilding and fishing augmented this water-based economy and the two cities were once major players in European ship construction. Today the largest ship yard in Europe is in Saint-Nazaire—the Chantiers navals de Saint-Nazaire, or the Chantiers de I 'Atlantique (the name of the local society in charge of the management and the organisation of shipyards until 2008). It is now owned by the Korean firm STX and employs around 2 000 workers.\",\"For example, the PLU for the commune of Saint-Nazaire attaches a great importance to the protection of natural areas, the location of production zones, and risks in the estuary. As the attractiveness of the sea shore is quite important, the PLU imposes restrictive rules related on construction in the coastal zone and tries to relocate new development two or three kilometres inland. Involving 24 communes around the City of Nantes it will establish the main directions for the broader project of territorial development to the year 2030. They are also trying to encourage increased participation in the process by public-private development companies (Societes publiques d’amenagement) and private investors to manage land use and local land acquisition operations, beyond the limited number of public programs.\",\"The value of water and adjacent land, in environmental terms is recognised, for example in the Parc Naturel Regional de Brieres, which is dedicated to the promotion of natural species and landscapes. Water is a key part of the local quality of life that makes the region attractive to migrants whether they come to work or to retire. More recently, water availability' has been associated with tourism activity as well, and Nantes Saint-Nazaire has become an attractive place for short and medium stays and leisure. First, the rivers are constant obstacles to the circulation of goods and the mobility of people.\",\"Beyond this, there is the full set of subnational spatial planning regulations at the regional, departement and commune level. In addition, communes in the departement of Loire-Atlantique, which includes Nantes and Saint-Nazaire as its two largest urban places, have been very active in creating an array of intercommunal agreements that further complicate the planning process, even as they provide a forum for collaborative actions. The two cities, which are approximately 50 kilometres apart from one another, are linked by the Pole metropolitain Nantes Saint-Nazaire association, which has developed a common spatial planning vision through the SCoT. In addition, Nantes is part of a Metropole, while Saint-Nazaire is part of a commununautes d 'agglomeration.\",\"This is because they are far more prominent in the literature. Further, the word commune is used in lieu of municipality throughout this report, along with intercommunalites (instead of intermunicipalities). It offers background context for the case studies of Clermont-Ferrand and Nantes Saint-Nazaire that follow. The chapter begins with a section that describes subnational government roles and functions, and a description of fiscal relations at the local government level.\",\"One of these employs the idea of a “bassin de vie” to argue that the appropriate geographic unit for optimizing quality of life has a small geography, especially in rural territories. “ Basssins de vie” in France are defined as an area where people both live and work, and where they can obtain the vast majority of the services that they need locally. The logic in this theory is that a high degree of physical and social connectedness leads to a better quality of life and to better local decision making.\",\"More precisely, the question at stake is how to integrate the project of the various intercommunalites, w'ith their own level of constraints and local solutions, into a larger scale than single municipalities. By doing so, these individuals are able to bring local ideas and projects to a supra level, and have the potential to overcome difficulties based on the differences between territories. For example, the north littoral is filled with elderly people, whereas in the south there are mostly younger couples with children.

Non-profit organisations such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in the United States have developed qualitative indicators for liveable ageing societies. These were developed with such stakeholders as community residents, representatives of particular groups and policy makers. Qualitative indicators, on the other hand, should be used not merely to compare results or rank communities, but to collect critical information that cannot be expressed or evaluated quantitatively. Some case study cities apply indicators to understand their challenges better and to monitor the progress of their policies. Cologne monitors the expansion of high-quality educational opportunities for older people, as well as the demand for and supply of social housing.\",\"The suggested approach by type of city is almost applicable to all types of cities, however, some key messages that each type of city should keep in mind as relatively high importance compared to other types are as follow: Type III cities (young cities, ageing slowly) need to bear in mind that such strategies will build the community’s understanding of the needs of older people in the long run, as well as of the demands of ageing societies that it will have to confront. Those strategies can provide instructive opportunities for learning to adjust to such changes.

One such example, Cologne’s multigenerational Living for Help programme, helps students find accommodation in the homes of older people. This project serves the needs of both generations, offering students housing and older people services and support at home. Meanwhile, it helps build community awareness and mutual support networks and provides services within a community that are not currently addressed by existing government programmes.\",\"Elderly people who volunteer can provide a solution to fill this growing gap, which is particularly pronounced in adult social care services.

The organisation received additional revenues of EUR 18 100 from the community' budget. As a result, Morelos’ state policy for tourism has a very weak territorial development component. Two initiatives may be highlighted as exceptions: “Pact for Development of Altos de Morelos” and the Tourism Development Program of Southern Region of the State of Morelos (Gobiemo de Morelos, 2013b).\",\"These land uses are declining and consequently, low bushes and trees are quickly spreading across these areas in the absence of grazing animals which would normally help contain such growth. This affects the accessibility of the land for tourism. Thus, the landscapes are changing and the Puys mountains may become somewhat less accessible for tourists as a result.\",\"It also promotes a greater interaction between the budgetary plans and the programmes of various state agencies in order to ensure that interests converge towards common tourism development goals. However, Morelos’ tourism policy is being implemented through the use of instruments that are common to all Mexican states in their relationship with the federal government. These include agreements with the Tourism Promotion Council of Mexico (marketing) and its counterpart at the state level, but also agreements and reallocation of resources from the Ministry of Tourism of Morelos with its national counterpart (SECTUR). Spreading and promoting more effectively information on the strong tourism assets that exist in many areas of the state should be a central concern to Morelos’ destination development policy.

Since the 1990s, population growth in the Puy-de-Dome departement has been concentrated in the north-south corridor of the territory surrounding Clermont-Ferrand, following the major road. The peri-urban areas around Clermont-Ferrand have seen particularly strong growth. This land is seeing an increase in both the elderly population and that of children—peri-urban spaces are an attractive place for both those retiring and those who are raising young families.\",\"At present, different land uses—industrial activities, farming, natural areas, touristic zones, infrastructure, and residential zones—are sometimes located in close proximity to one another, which can lead to conflict. The increasing emphasis on natural resource based tourism is exacerbating some associated land use conflicts. Increased tourism numbers leads to congestion at a minimum and may reduce the inherent quality of the natural resources that are a primary reason for visiting the region, especially in the mountains and the hillsides near the city of Clermont-Ferrand.\",\"House prices steeply increased in the 2000s but fell mid 2008 only to recover thereafter. When one compares median house prices to that of taxable income as a measure of housing affordability, Clermont-Ferrand fares well, it stands in the top quartile for housing affordability by this measure among French agglomerations. Agglomerations with a high number of secondary residences tend to have the lowest affordability by the measure (e.g. Antibes, Menton and Bayone for which secondary residences comprise approximately 20% more of the housing stock). In contrast, secondary residences in the Clermont-Ferrand agglomeration are 9% of housing stock, but are increasing in share as access to the region improves and prices in other locations continue to increase. Suburban areas now have a less mixed land use pattern than in the past, and include an increasing volume of developed parcels of land. Using a common typology, Clermont’s suburbs have shifted from peri-urban zones under rural influence to peri-urban zones under urban influence.\",\"It is further important that some elements of local control should be constrained by higher level priorities because local preferences for specific land uses may not be compatible with broader social welfare objectives. In Greater Clermont-Ferrand, specific local conditions provide important limitations and opportunities for development and hence for specific uses of land. The limitations imposed by this geographical feature has at the same time created the necessity to develop local and co-ordinated land use policies in order to avoid local competition and land use conflict.\",\"At the local level, there exist four main types of planning documents (documents d’urbanisme) that govern land use occupation and changes: i) the SCoT (Schema de Coherence Territorial), ii) local plans, PLU and PLUI, iii) the carte communale (which provides a map of buildable and non-buildable areas), iv) and national urban law which is enforceable even in the absence of a SCOT or PLU. It is also encouraged through the possibility to undertake intercommunal local urban development plans (PLUI), something that Greater Clermont-Ferrand has not yet engaged in. The current land use plan for Clermont-Ferrand relates only to the commune (PLU).\",\"Today the company’s production facilities are dispersed but its research and development facilities remain concentrated in Clermont-Ferrand. This shift took place over a number of years, thus lessening the blow of employment loss and aiding in the transition to new industries. The region as a whole lost 20 000 industrial jobs over the duration of the past ten years, a trend that was mimicked across France, with similar overall declines in industrial employment (Wazsak, n.d.). The Auvergne region accounted for 2.5% out of all French industrial employment and ranked 8th among all metropolitan industrial areas in France in 2010 (Wazsak, n.d.). Today Clermont-Ferrand employs the majority of the industrial workforce in the region (around 35%), most notably in the rubber industries, food processing and metallurgy. The main industrial areas are located in the north of the city and include a number of brownfield sites.\",\"Further, with the Auvergne and Rhone-Alpes regions recently being merged to form one new region, Clermont-Ferrand loses its status as a regional capital and along with this, public sector employment and institutions. Although the region has several strengths, a key challenge is devising a development strategy that will allow a transition to a new role. Accompanying the changes in economic and political functions will be changes in the way land is used.\",\"This was not an issue when Clermont-Ferrand was the capital of the Auvergne Region because of the polarisation around the agglomeration in terms of various public services. With the emergence of Lyon as the new regional capital, an important part of local economic activity may turn away from the Clermont pole. Overtime, this could reduce Clermont-Ferrand attractiveness for residents and business, which could reduce the rate of demographic and economic growth. Nestled in the Massif Central Mountains, the area’s transport connections are relatively poor. There is no high speed train (TGV) connection, and there are no plans for one to be developed at present. It presently takes more than three hours to reach Paris by train.\",\"This is most visible in Coumon d’Auvergne, which has grown from an agricultural village to become the second largest city in the departement. The “city in the countryside” feature has had a major influence on the Eastern side of the Limagne plain, but also on the hills after the collapse of wine-production. This has led to a need for new infrastructure alongside these main channels in order to service new developments. In turn, this opens up the area for development and leads to further urbanisation, including in areas that are costly for the municipality to provide services to and that impose environmental costs (e.g. the cost of expanding infrastructure and the costs of commuting).\",\"The pace of urbanisation is quite regular, but is proceeding even slower than was expected by the current SCoT. Despite aspirations to increase density within the city, suburbanisation and peri-urbanisation continue apace and appear difficult to stop (Box 2.8). At the same time, even if the core of the city provides building opportunities on the old industrial land, the process of reconversion is difficult to handle because of the cost of remediating soil pollution and the possibility of archaeological constraints. But, in Clermont-Ferrand, as in other urban places, there seems to be a clear preference by many households for this type for dispersed development, and not the more compact approach favoured by planners and city officials. As has been discussed, this imposes a number of costs and externalities including the environmental costs of commuting and fiscal costs borne by the municipality when expanding and servicing infrastructure to peri-urban areas.\",\"Further, this strategy is consistent with present aims to increase density in central Clermont-Ferrand and to improve the efficiency of land use in the suburbs. Finally, the strategy could be used to enhance the relationship between Clermont and its hinterland and rebalance the perception that the hinterland is solely at the service of the city. In order to avoid the risk of an increased polarisation of the rural activities towards the Lyon metropole, it is important to build strong linkages with these territories to counteract such an effect. The volume of opposition between various land users remains quite high. Consequently, land based conflicts have arisen, resulting from both the lack of space and the intense competition between different development projects, supported by individuals or groups of people. This crucial requirement maybe fulfilled by an increased involvement of the local population at the earlier stages of the decision making process and by creating bilateral exchanges between the local planners and developers on the one hand, and the local population on the other.\",\"Similarly, in Clermont-Ferrand the main objective for the different levels of spatial planning is to form a stronger agglomeration that can restart economic growth in the face of a slowdown in key industries and the potential negative effects of losing the status of being an independent region. However, in a market economy, it is more difficult to ensure that land uses specified in the spatial plan actually occur. For example, while spatial plans may seek to keep specific parcels of land in farming, if returns from farming are too low, the land will simply be abandoned. This asymmetry points to a crucial challenge for spatial planning: blocking specific undesirable land uses is far easier than achieving desired land uses.\",\"This evolution could lead to dramatic changes for the Clermont metropole. It has lost its status of regional capital and its activities will be challenged by the two other cities—Lyon and Grenoble. Moreover, Lyon and Grenoble officially benefit from the enhanced status of metropoles (along with 11 other cities in France), which means that they have a comparative advantages in terms of funding and that they can control and make contracts with their hinterland in an easier way than can Clermont-Ferrand.\",\"It was created to strengthen the role of the Auvergne metropolitan area as a counterpart to the neighbouring metropoles of Lyon and Grenoble. It is responsible for developing and implementing the Territorial Coherence Plan (SCoT). It is a mixed syndicate, composed of 108 communes, including Clermont-Ferrand and 8 communities of communes.5 The area encompassing Grand Clermont is depicted the map below (Figure 2.6).\",\"For planning purposes, regions will pursue integrated planning and broad economic development strategies, departements will focus on providing social development and related services, and communes will focus on land use plans and local public services. The argument for consolidations follows both a cost-savings approach (eliminating about half the regional governments) and a scale approach (creating bigger regions that can be more efficient providers of services and investments). However, it is a contentious project and, as the map below indicates, some former regional capitals will lose their status along with the attendant public sector employment, services and other associated advantages (a point returned to in Chapter 2 in the case study of Clermont-Ferrand).\",\"Natural or agricultural areas are easily reachable for urban dwellers and the reverse can be said for mral inhabitants willing to spend some time in the central agglomeration. It is also offers a chance to strengthen local agricultural connections in the form of higher value local foods and additional value-added processing. Taking advantage of these opportunities requires increased collaboration between different types of economic and institutional structures under the umbrella of the Grand Clermont, as well as the setting of co-ordinated land use planning policies (see Box 2.9 for a discussion of common governance frameworks for rural-urban partnerships). Absent an articulation of how this creates better opportunities for surrounding communes, it is difficult to see how they can justify ongoing participation in the arrangement.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"22_clermontferrand_land_clermont\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"22_clermontferrand_land_clermont\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[-2.3246195,-2.328338,-2.2967415,-2.2985046,-2.29946,-2.2905922,-2.34068,-2.3197234,-2.3409746,-2.2942061,-2.3119035,-2.307659,-2.3032854,-2.33763,-2.3351216,-2.2571774,-2.1217735,-2.3004935],\"y\":[7.1374235,7.144704,7.1213317,7.1292243,7.134597,7.1242285,7.1586533,7.138675,7.1544895,7.154872,7.137416,7.127222,7.1318736,7.156476,7.1567006,7.0356636,6.9551654,7.1234536],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"As a result, “anchor” investment projects do not always result in economic diversification. Few monotowns attracted new' investment projects from SOEs, except in Stepnogorsk (where an SOE, the core manufacturing company, has been expanding production). As reported by BISAM Central Asia (2012), outsourcing to local monotown businesses is not always advantageous to core monotown companies, given their vertically integrated structure or the insufficient quality of local production.\",\"However, even though the methodology and structure allows CDPs to reflect each monotown’s specific priorities, the same target indicators were imposed from the national monotown programme. According to BISAM Central Asia (2012), they often do not reflect the specifics of each monotown, and are sometimes overly optimistic and unachievable (especially as regards SME indicators). Employment and population forecasts in CDPs tend to be optimistic as compared to actual figures. For instance, Stepnogorsk CDP’s forecast (made in 2014) overestimated employment in 2015 by almost 2000 (or 5%).47 Over-optimistic forecasts may signal that monotow'ns’ akimats do not adequately reflect population decline or stagnation in urban and economic planning.\",\"In addition, a Contractor\\u002fSupplier Boot Camp helps to link SMEs and the major industrial companies by providing them with training on what the major companies need and want, and what their requirements are (Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 2015). There is convincing evidence that labour productivity in Russian monotowns is substantially lower than average. Commander, Nikoloski and Plekhanov (2011) found that the output of enterprises in one-company towns is 70% lower than their peers, after controlling for other factors.\",\"However, in Kazakhstan, it is closely associated with poverty and lower income levels (World Bank, 2016b). While unemployment rates are relatively low and do not vary much across Kazakhstan’s monotowns, self-employment may be a more appropriate indicator for identifying monotowns with a depressed labour market.43 A high level of self-employment is highly correlated with lower average wages across Kazakhstan’s monotowns44 and urban areas as a whole. The 27 monotowns accounted for 14% of Kazakhstan’s urban population at the beginning of 2016, but almost 19% of the urban population in 1999.\",\"According to the monotow'n programme, salaries account for around 50%-60% of overall household income in monotowns. In 2009, a few' had a substantially lower share of tertiary-educated residents than the average for urban areas (20%) and the median percentage for Kazakhstan’s 87 towns (see Figure 1.29 above). A low share of tertiary educated residents is common for mining or factory town populations. Self-employment offers an alternative source of income for households after the downsizing or closure of core industries in a town.\",\"However, since 2009, the population of most monotowns has risen (if usually at a slower pace than in urban Kazakhstan as a whole), as opposed to the steep demographic decline in the previous decade. Population declined in only 8 of the 27 monotowns in the 2009-2016 period, most dramatically in Serebryansk (which has experienced rapid out-migration) and Zyrianovsk. In the same period, around half of monotowns experienced negative net migrations (i.e. net migration outflows, see Figure 1.31).\",\"This makes monotowns economically vulnerable in times of crisis and economic decline, and increases social vulnerability. Monotowns were particularly widespread in the Soviet Union, a reflection of the size, low' population density, and significant deposits of natural resources located in remote, inhospitable regions. In Kazakhstan, monotowns are defined as cities where at least 20% of industrial output and the employed population is concentrated in one or a few' core enterprises of the same industry.41 Monotowns (usually focused on mining or sometimes fishing activities) have also been common in OECD countries such as Canada, Australia and the United States. The specificity of Soviet and post-Soviet monotowns is that i) they are the result of long-term central planning, ii) they were based on supply chains based on substantial transport and energy subsidies, and iii) the main enterprise or group of enterprises (hereafter, core company or companies) acted as the supplier of municipal utilities (w'ater, sew'age and sometimes district heating when it existed) and housing for its employees (BISAM Central Asia, 2012).\",\"Support for entrepreneurship in monotowns has a dedicated budget line, but a freeze was declared on new projects requiring budget financing in 2015. On the whole, the maintenance and renewal of municipal utility and electricity distribution networks, city roads and other municipal infrastructure items account for the bulk of the monotown programme budget spending in monotowns. This has improved municipal utility networks, roads and electricity networks in monotowns, but in many of them, the lack of (formal) employment opportunities remains a pressing issue. The central criterion for assessing “anchor” projects is the forecast number of new jobs.\",\"If spatial and economic plans fail to take into account the reality of a declining city, disproportionately large education and health facilities will put a heavy burden on municipal and regional public finances. The programme has a comprehensive approach of monotown development. It has three major goals: i) developing and improving urban infrastructure (roads, municipal utility networks) and the housing stock, ii) economic diversification and SME development to increase employment, and iii) increasing labour mobility to stimulate voluntary movement to areas with higher social and economic development potential.\",\"The sheer remoteness and poor road and railway connectivity to large urban centres typical of many monotow'ns is a powerful obstacle to economic diversification, especially toward manufacturing activities. Indeed, since transport costs for raw' materials tend to be lower than those for manufactured goods, high transport costs tend to reinforce the specialisation in raw' commodities and constitute yet another barrier that producers of higher-value manufactures must overcome in order to compete (OECD, 2015c). In 10 monotowns, real wage growth has been negative (Figure 1.28).\",\"Based on a national methodology, oblast akimats classified monotow'ns into high, medium and low categories based on their economic potential (Box 1.10). Each monotown also prepared a “Comprehensive Development Plan” (hereafter, CDP, or Compleksnie programmi razvitia, in Russian) that details capital investments required to upgrade urban infrastructure (roads, municipal utility networks and housing) and investment projects that could contribute to diversifying the town’s economic structure. Most CDPs have the same target indicators: unemployment rate, number of SMEs with a real business activity, investments in fixed assets by companies, rate of degraded municipal utility (water, sewage, district heating) and electricity distribution networks. Sometimes industrial output (in volume) or population numbers are also target indicators. However, of 27 monotowns, only two (Janatass and Arkalik) are classified as having low' economic potential. Other monotowns have high or medium economic potential.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"23_monotowns_monotown_municipal\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"23_monotowns_monotown_municipal\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[-0.99203926,-0.9934616,-0.98356366,-0.9743412,-0.97776574,-0.97245,-0.9852863,-0.9919162,-0.9928679,-1.0078725,-0.9789956,-0.9864145],\"y\":[9.41241,9.411791,9.409534,9.413186,9.418409,9.412565,9.413654,9.412743,9.410502,9.424344,9.394826,9.412179],\"type\":\"scattergl\"}],
