# SDOH-Models
Social Determinants of Health Machine Learning Models

SDOH-Models features ML models and data extract procedures for SDOH. The repo supports examples
and case studies documented in __[SocialHealthAI.org](http://socialhealthai.org)__.

Jupyter notebooks are organized in a standard folder structure:
- chronic-disease (ML notebooks for chronic diseases)
- condition (ML notebooks for health conditions)
- environment (notebooks to establish environment)
- etl (data extract & clean notebooks)
- features (notebooks used for feature selection)

See story __[Finding the Best SDOH Features for Your Data Science Project](http://socialhealthai.org/ai-solutions/finding-the-best-sdoh-features-for-your-data-science-project/)__ 
to see how environment, etl and features notebooks are used.
